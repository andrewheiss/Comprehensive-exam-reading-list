LDS Charities—the official humanitarian wing of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (Mormons)—has long struggled to obtain permission to legally provide its humanitarian services in countries ruled by dictators. The organization offers a variety of services, including neonatal resuscitation training, wheelchair delivery, eye exams, disaster relief, and direct assistance to local orphanages, leprosariums, and medical centers, but its legal status is often ambiguous. Beginning in the early 1990s, the LDS Church worked with former Egyptian president Ḥosni Mubarak to allow LDS Charities to formally register as a foreign charity. Year after year, Mubarak would signal his approval, with the caveat that his Coptic Christian council would ultimately have the final say. However, this council regularly denied all requests for legalization until finally conceding in 2007. Why did Mubarak, an ostensibly omnipotent dictator, defer to his Christian advisors? He had the legal right to approve the request on his own, and given that Egypt was not a democracy, there was arguably little need to show deference for such a small decision.

Conversely, the Open Society Foundations (OSF)—a philanthropic organization backed by American billionaire George Soros—has promoted democratization throughout the world since at least the early 1990s, and has paid particular attention to pro-democracy advocacy and activism in the former Soviet states of Eastern Europe. OSF funds an array of initiatives and programs intended to improve education, strengthen independent media, bolster respect for human rights, and otherwise build democratic values in less democratic nations. However, more authoritarian states such as Russia have long criticized OSF for meddling in domestic affairs, controlling grassroots NGOs, and imposing foreign values in their countries. Despite this criticism, OSF has generally been able to continue supporting its programs and regularly funds and supports local NGOs working on these core issues. Surprisingly, in December 2015, OSF ceased all operations in Russia after being labeled an "undesirable organization"—a legal designation created by a 2015 law that allowed the government to blacklist and expel any organization it deemed too dangerous. OSF had been active in Russia for decades—why did the government wait until 2015 to finally end their operations?

Though they have radically different missions, the experiences of LDS Charities and the Open Society Foundations are indicative of a larger trend of closing civic space and worsening restrictions on international nongovernmental organizations (INGOs). Other examples abound—Greenpeace and The Asia Foundation work in China despite stricter rules for foreign NGOs, and Human Rights Watch maintains field offices in Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, and other Central Asian dictatorships under close government surveillance.[^1] 

Autocrats willingly allow these organizations to operate in their countries, but these regimes set the terms for INGO action. It is likely that Mubarak used LDS Charities and other humanitarian INGOs as pawns in domestic politics. Coptic Christians account for 10–15% of Egypt's population and are both politically active and fearful of persecution. By giving Coptic leaders some say in minor decisions, Mubarak could, in a way, placate them and help maintain the stability of his regime. Copts, in turn, felt threatened by foreign Christian groups that could change the balance of Eastern Christian dominance in the country, and thus did not want more Western Christian organizations to work in the country. Though the foreign organizations requesting access dealt with innocuous issues that posed little threat to his regime, Mubarak benefitted from imposing restrictive regulations on certain types of INGOs. Conversely, OSF and other foreign-backed NGOs played an outsized role in Russian domestic politics as Russian leaders feared creeping Western influence. Throughout 2015, Russia faced a flagging economy, nascent popular political dissent, and continuing military operations in Ukraine. By restricting these foreign organizations' operations and expelling them from the country, Putin helped shore up the stability and unity of his regime during a time of extreme volatility. In both cases, Mubarak and Putin regulated INGOs in pursuit of domestic regime stability.

Over the past decade, INGOs have become increasingly active in authoritarian regimes as they respond to emergencies, assist with development, or advocate for human rights. However, these services and advocacy can challenge the regime—INGOs that provide essential services such as public health or education can undercut the regime's role as a provider of public goods, and INGOs that advocate for human rights can challenge and embarrass regimes that regularly violate those rights. Despite these risks, the overwhelming majority of authoritarian countries continue to permit INGO activities. How do these regimes limit their exposure to the risks of INGOs? What determines when an autocrat will restrict civil society in their country?

In this paper, I investigate these questions, ultimately seeking to identify the determinants of civil society regulations in authoritarian regimes. I explore how authoritarian regimes determine and adjust the regulatory environment for civil society organizations in response to (1) anxiety over internal social and government stability, (2) fear of contagion from political instability in neighboring countries, and (3) concern about international reputation.


# Dictators and activists: Reluctant bedfellows

Today, nearly 30 years since the collapse of the Soviet Union, early optimism for a global "third wave" of democratization—the rapid transition of the world's last remaining autocracies to liberal democracy—appears quite quixotic. Although most authoritarian regimes hold democratic elections [@LevitskyWay:2010], allow for multiparty legislatures [@Blaydes:2011], empower an independent judiciary [@GinsburgMoustafa:2008], or use independent central banks to set monetary policy [@Boylan:2001], authoritarianism remains durable. Instead of democratizing, dictatorships don "democratic garb" [@Brownlee:2007, 25] and delegate authority to other domestic institutions in part to maintain their own power, offsetting domestic pressure and boosting their international reputation [@GandhiPrzeworski:2007]. 

Little research, however, has attempted to explain authoritarian treatment of domestic and transnational civil society through a similar institutional lens. By viewing civil society as yet another institutional actor that autocrats have to balance, we can begin to answer crucial questions: Why do self-interested autocrats allow INGOs to operate in their borders, and what determines how autocrats regulate civil society in their borders?

## Authoritarian institutional balancing

Dictators are rarely omnipotent or invulnerable. Autocrats must carefully balance external actors and institutions to remain in power [@LevitskyWay:2010], a phenomenon I term *institutional balancing* (see @fig:balancing). This theoretical strain emphasizes the fact that autocrats are often very precariously positioned—regimes can collapse if they are unable to balance their rivals [@Heiss:2012; @Svolik:2009]. In this view, authoritarianism is a complex multi-level game played by the regime, elites, the opposition, international actors, activists, and social movements. Instead of looking at a monolithic autocrat who rules over everything in the polity with impunity, authoritarianism is best viewed as a dynamic form of governance, with constant legislative, constitutional, and other pseudo democratic institutional reforms [@Stacher:2012, 31].

![Example of an authoritarian regime balancing multiple domestic and international institutional actors](../../Graphics/balancing){#fig:balancing}

Political institutions lie at the core of modern authoritarianism. An autocrat interested in maintaining power over their population without turning to absolute totalitarianism can either (1) outlaw opposition to their policies through political repression, or (2) improve the popularity of their policies by manufacturing political loyalty [@Wintrobe:1990]. Institutions are the primary mechanism for both of these strategies. Autocrats can establish narrow institutions like consultative councils and executive cabinets to give voice to elites and build patronage, or create democratic-appearing institutions like legislatures, elections, or civil society to generate popular loyalty and mitigate threats from society or the opposition [@Kendall-TaylorFrantz:2014a; @Gandhi:2006; @GandhiPrzeworski:2007]. In either case, if "rulers counter [threats to their power] with an adequate degree of institutionalization, they survive in power" [@GandhiPrzeworski:2007, 284]. Ultimately, the persistence or collapse of authoritarian regimes depends on the quality and management of their institutional restraints and rivals [@Brownlee:2007, 202], not the magnitude of repression or violence against their citizens.

Because it is infeasible and costly to rely solely on violent oppression to maintain power, autocrats typically allow for a degree of institutional dissonance and competition [@Brumberg:2002]. However, this dissonance creates an interesting (and potentially destabilizing) dynamic. If the political institutions in a regime are competitive enough, opponents and activists can use them as a means for obtaining actual power within the government [@FrantzKendall-Taylor:2014]. Under this form of competitive authoritarianism, there is genuine competition for power through elections, though the playing field is generally skewed toward the incumbents [@LevitskyWay:2010]. Political competition under authoritarianism is "real but unfair" [@LevitskyWay:2010, 5]—but still real. Efforts to influence, control, or diminish opposing institutions can often backfire, highlighting the bidirectional relationship between the regime and external actors.

## Civil society as a political institution

In addition to traditional regime-constraining political institutions like elections, judicial systems, and legislatures, we can gain significant analytic and theoretical insight into authoritarian politics by looking at civil society through an institutionalist lens. The idea of a civil society has long been salient in political science, with commentators as early as De Tocqueville theorizing on the importance of groups of citizens that actively engage with their governments to advocate for reform, rights, change, and other services. Civil society is traditionally defined as "an agglomeration of private, voluntary organizations that have the capacity to assert the rights of individuals and groups," [@Cook:2007, 143] and is most commonly operationalized as nongovernmental organizations (NGOs),[^2] or organizations that operate outside of both the private and public sectors, ostensibly filling social gaps left by firms and governments [@AhmedPotter:2006, 30; see also @Hansmann:1980]. Civil society need not be explicitly political or rights-focused—any sort of association, including bowling clubs and parent/teacher associations, allows citizens to come in contact with each other, build social capital, and aggregate individual preferences [@Putnam:1994].

While formal institutional theory has typically been applied to more traditional institutions such as constitutions, electoral systems, legislative committee assignments, or judiciary structures, these theories can be usefully applied to non-traditional political phenomena like civil society. In particular, institutional theory allows us to see how civil society as an institution lowers transaction costs and promotes coordinated collective action against or in support of the state. Regimes must contend with, balance out, and adapt to these organizations in order to survive.

Simply put, institutions are the collection of rules that define the parameters of social activity, or the "humanly devised constraints that shape human interactions" [@North:1990, 3]. These sets of rules create equilibria and structure the relationships between rival political actors, dictate who can make decisions, which actions are allowed or prohibited, and how obedience is rewarded and disobedience punished [@Ostrom:1990, 51; @Knight:1992, 126]. Institutions can range from formal structures like constitutions and property ownership regimes to informal social and cultural norms, practices, and traditions. Ultimately, institutions—both formal and informal—gain traction in society because they reduce the transaction costs of social and economic interaction and help actors achieve Pareto efficiency. Additionally, institutions can help foster trust between actors—when players interact, they can trust that their counterparts will behave appropriately because of the rules of the underlying institutional framework.[^3] 

Conceptualizing civil society as an institution yields the greatest theoretical advantage when considering how civil society organizations and NGOs relate to the states they work in. Civil society has typically been defined in one of two ways.[^4] The first school of thought, championed by @Putnam:1994, holds that vibrant associational life forges links that cross social boundaries—bowling clubs, parent/teacher associations, neighborhood groups, volunteer organizations, and other nonprofit groups tend to include members from multiple social strata, thereby breaking down vertical social boundaries and increasing social trust. This associational life increases civic engagement, embeds norms of reciprocity into society, and helps improve democratic governance—in other words, civil society ultimately *strengthens and bolsters* the state and reinforces the equilibrium between state and society.[^5] 

Others have argued that civil society should stand *in opposition to* the state. The deeper social connections formed by participating in associational life can allow members of these organizations to "stand up to city hall" [@Jamal:2007, 4], to pursue their community self-interests, or to help maintain moral order and social norms. In this view, civil society organizations act as watchdogs against the government (or private sector), providing members of society with a focal point for popular mobilization. While discussing the institutional foundation for public morality—norms that shape the preferences and payoffs for players in a society—Platteau argues:

> A civil society helps to back trust whenever there is a sufficient number of citizens who feel vengeful enough to work towards exposing publicly the illegal acts or malpractices of both private and state agents, and towards bringing enough pressure to sanction them even though such actions entail significant costs to themselves (by denouncing economic crimes they produce a public good) [@Platteau:2000, 308].

The fact that the denouncement of grievances is a public good is key to civil society's role as a social focal point. @Ostrom:1990 convincingly argues that social norms (defined as institutions) allow communities to police and regulate common-pool resources—rival but non-excludable goods that behave similar to more traditional public goods. To prevent overfishing, communities of Turkish fishermen developed detailed social norms to dictate where fishing is permissible on which days by which fishermen. Without those norms, an aggrieved fisherman whose area on a lake is depleted by a rival has no recourse; with these norms, the fisherman has recourse to social shaming, stigma, and compensation. Similarly, a single aggrieved citizen alone cannot directly challenge the state or a firm with much efficacy. However, institutional structures allow them to address those grievances, thus providing the public good of engagement with the state. 

@Weingast:1997 provides a more general explanation of how institutions can provide this public good, arguing that institutions prevent rulers from infringing on the rights of their citizens by organizing a "coordinated understanding" of the violation of those rights and allowing citizens to more easily coordinate and respond to potential abuses. That is, when citizens face government abuse, they face a coordination dilemma—they must convince other citizens to band with them to seek redress against the government, which is often difficult. Institutions solve this coordination dilemma in two ways: (1) institutions such as constitutions, legal structures, and civil society provide mechanisms that allow citizens to initially seek redress (e.g. an aggrieved citizen has a constitutional right to sue the government; nonprofit organizations are legally allowed to provide community services the government may be unable to deliver, etc.), and (2) those institutions generate a coordinated understanding—or the expectation that something must and shall be done to address government abuses—among a nation's citizens [@Weingast:1997, 262]. Non-aggrieved citizens assist those who are victims of government abuse because (1) there are institutions in place that allow for redress, and (2) the citizens who are not victims expect that the current victims will come to their aid in the future. Because of this ability to rally popular support for collective action, civil society can be seen as a critical watchdog against government and private sector abuses and thereby protect citizens against the state. This, in turn, can redefine the equilibrium between the two actors, as states seek to regulate and reshape their relationship to civil society organizations that pose potential threats to their ideal preferences.

It is more useful, however, to move beyond the normative debates over these two extremes of civil society skepticism (that it serves only to build the state) and civil society utopianism (that it serves only to protect against the state) and instead treat civil society as simply an institutional vehicle for coordinating collective action. A key implication of this argument is that the relationship between institutions within a state is rarely unidirectional—any political institution can either act independently or be acted upon by other institutions, such as the ruling regime, legislature, or private sector. As an institution, civil society can exert influence on a regime, pressuring and shaming it to follow specific norms. Conversely, civil society can also be directed, co-opted, or controlled by the state to help ensure a regime's survival. 

# International NGOs: yet another actor to be balanced

Authoritarian institutional balancing is not limited solely to domestic institutions. States today confront a complex stew of domestic and international issues and actors, where activists, bureaucrats, legislators, judges, firms, civil society organizations, intergovernmental organizations (IGOs), media organizations, and foreign states interact and influence domestic policy and behavior [@Linos:2013; @Slaughter:2004]. Similar to their domestic counterparts, international NGOs can provide particularly acute pressure against authoritarian regimes, especially as they work in concert with domestic NGOs to pressure and shame states that behave poorly. Domestic NGOs that are restricted or blocked by their government will turn to allies in the international NGO community, who will in turn lobby their home states to convince international organizations like the UN to put high-level pressure on the offending regime, thereby creating an opening for the original domestic civil society organizations to advocate for policy changes. This relocation of advocacy power follows a boomerang pattern, moving from domestic NGOs to INGOs to foreign states and international organizations to domestic NGOs again [@Keck:1998]. 

With repeated boomerang-like pressure from domestic NGOs and INGOs, responses to individual issues can evolve into human rights norms, resulting in the institutionalization of new policies and practices within an offending state. @RisseSikkink:1999 describe this process of norm socialization as a spiral, or a sequence of repeated boomerang effects. Domestic actors repeatedly turn to INGOs and transnational networks for help in their advocacy and slowly wear down the state. Initially the state denies the accusations of repression and claims that foreign human rights norms are invalid, but with repeated domestic and international pressure, the regime will begin to make concessions to the human rights network. Continued pressure helps formalize these concessions into actual legislation, and as politicians adhere to these policies (again because of domestic and international boomerang effects), they internalize the human rights norms that underpin the policies, thus resulting in long-lasting reform.

Relying on non-state actors as part of stability-seeking institutional balancing is fraught with risk—INGOs are wildcards in authoritarian regimes [@DeMars:2005]. INGOs have real effects on domestic politics and policies and pose significant risks to the regimes that allow them to operate. Previous research has found that countries receiving negative evaluations in human rights INGO reports and press releases see a marked reduction in foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows [@BarryClayFlynn:2013] and tend to respond with better compliance to international human rights norms [@Murdie:2012]. Close networks of development NGOs and INGOs in countries with weak national governments can even marginalize the state: in South Asia and Eastern and Southern Africa, nations are far more dependent on aid than trade in part because of the activities of development INGOs [@Stiles:2002], while INGOs in countries like Haiti and Afghanistan vie for control over territorial "fiefdoms" and rival the central government in power and influence [@Schuller:2012].

![Percent of dictatorships that allow domestic and international institutions](../../Output/figures/0-ingos-dictatorships){#fig:ingos-dictatorships}

In spite of the risks of dealing with INGOs, authoritarians are increasingly opening up their countries to INGO advocacy and services. @Kendall-TaylorFrantz:2014a show that in general, institutionalization in authoritarian regimes has increased substantially since 1970, as dictatorships permit pseudo-democratic electoral institutions, such as party politics and competitive elections. In @fig:ingos-dictatorships I replicate their work and add a fourth indicator to measure the institutionalization of INGOs in dictatorships. The figure shows the percentage of dictatorships where more than 500 INGOs report having members.[^6] Since the 1980s, international associational life has grown to become a nearly universal feature of autocratic rule—by 2004, 90% of dictatorships had at least 500 INGOs with registered members in their countries.

## Controlling civic space to curtail INGO influence

Though associational life has increased, regimes have worked to control its expansion by imposing formal and informal restrictions on INGO activity. In a survey I conducted with Judith Kelley [@HeissKelley:2016; @Kelley:2017], 480 human trafficking NGOs answered questions about their work in 133 different countries, and 24% reported feeling either somewhat or very restricted by the governments of 66 different countries. The nature of these restrictions varied, ranging from strict legal requirements to general government antagonism or apathy toward INGO programming. For example, one INGO working in Southeast Asia reported "[a]ll work must be approved and done in direct concert with government counterparts. [Our] presence in country [is] controlled and evaluated by government officials, even those who are not familiar with our work,"[^7] while another stated that "we had to be certified and continue to submit to monthly reporting, mandatory financial audits, site visits, social welfare approval, government regulations regarding our aftercare property, work permits for all foreign volunteers, annual reporting and additional certifications."[^8] Some NGOs responded that informal restrictions, such as corruption and inefficiency in the police and government bureaucracy, also limit the programming these organizations can do in-country. The responses from this survey led me to investigate this phenomenon further, and in 2016 I conducted a survey of more than 600 INGOs working in 148 countries.[^9] I found similar results—19% of responding INGOs reported feeling moderately to extremely restricted across 72 different countries, and many respondents complained of government intrusion into their programs. 

One recurring theme in both these surveys is INGOs' observation that government restrictions are calibrated to help the regime, such that "[a]ll of our work is seen through the lens of … party priorities."[^10] Sovereign nations engage with international organizations and transnational civil society selectively, depending on rational calculations of how that engagement might be beneficial to the regime. Authoritarian regimes in particular tend to follow international norms and allow INGO operations only when doing so "allows the regime to (1) shore up its authority and legitimacy and to (2) deflect international pressures" [@Hawkins:1997, 407–8, *numbers added*]. Autocrats can use INGOs and other non-state actors to stabilize and reinforce their political power at home. For example, because competition for foreign patronage created an absence of strong links between Russian advocacy groups and the public, the Russian state has been able to restructure the civil society sector so that only NGOs that "work on issues that align with the national interest" receive funding and support [@Henderson:2010, 254], short-circuiting international "spiral" pressure and silencing domestic advocacy movements. 

Authoritarian regimes will also use INGOs and other non-state actors to improve their international reputations. @Kelley:2012 argues that because election monitoring has become a global norm, governments—even those who fully intend on cheating and manipulating the election—permit election monitoring INGOs as a way of appearing credible and democratic to peer nations. To ensure that monitoring efforts do indeed improve the regime's reputation, authoritarian governments will try to circumvent international monitors or purposely invite friendly (or bribable) monitors to counterbalance more objective organizations. Because of this, election monitors can ultimately "contribute to the false legitimization of governments" [@Kelley:2012, 155]. 

These rational strategies have the potential to backfire, however, since authoritarians are rarely able to fully control all rival actors. Though inviting election monitors can provide substantial reputational benefits, research has found that the presence of high-quality monitors can make it more difficult to cheat and is associated with better election quality, fewer violations of electoral law, and more incumbent turnover [@Kelley:2012, 124]—rulers in competitive authoritarian regimes can lose monitored elections. In post-revolutionary Egypt, international human rights monitoring organizations like Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International have benefitted from increased operational latitude as the different regimes have sought to bolster their international reputation. With this greater flexibility, these organizations have been able to issue dozens of reports condemning the government for its human rights abuses. Increased transnational oversight into Egyptian human rights has led to increased international shaming and condemnation.

# When do dictators restrict civil society?

As with other institutions, autocrats engage with international organizations and transnational civil society selectively, depending on rational calculations of how that engagement might be beneficial to the regime. Authoritarian regimes in particular tend to follow international norms and allow INGO operations only when doing so allows the government to "shore up its authority and legitimacy" and "deflect international pressures" [@Hawkins:1997, 407–8]. Key to harnessing this institutional dissonance for stability, however, is the autocrat's ability to manage and control these external actors. Through formal regulations and legislation and the de facto implementation of those laws, autocrats can use INGOs and other non-state actors to stabilize and reinforce their political power at home. I argue that the restrictiveness of a regime's civil society regulatory environment (or CSRE) is a function of three general factors, each connected to the challenge of authoritarian institutional balancing and each a potential threat to regime stability. 

First, tensions and conflict *within* a country pose serious threats to regime stability, given that regimes can collapse under the threat of competitive elections, intensification of ethnic conflicts, or revolutions and uprisings [@Heiss:2012; @Svolik:2009]. During times of domestic instability and unrest, autocratic regimes face increased threats from various institutional actors. For instance, when facing civil or ethnic conflict, the behavior of the military and opposition parties will be more uncertain, and when facing economic crises, a nation's central bank, labor unions, and general population will be more contentious and unpredictable, making the act of institutional balancing much more precarious. To maintain balance, dictators must consolidate against threats to stability and limit the allowable institutional dissonance. If the regime itself is unstable and incohesive—that is, if fissions and fractures among the ruling elite threaten government stability—the regime should have a similar response, constricting existing institutions and limiting their possible influence. This dynamic leads to the following hypotheses:

> **H~1a~**: As a country's domestic political instability increases, the *more* autocrats restrict the regulatory environment for civil society

> **H~1b~**: As the internal cohesion of a regime deteriorates, the *more* autocrats restrict the regulatory environment for civil society

Threats to a regime's institutional balance are not limited to domestic, internal events. Economic, political, military, ethnic, and humanitarian crises can spill over to neighboring states and can have a strong negative effect on a country's political stability and economic performance [@AdesChua:1997]. Beyond general political and military risk in neighboring countries, actual destabilizing events—in particular coups d'etat and popular protests—throughout a region likely influence a regime's decision making and survival strategy. Protests leading to regime change have a propensity to diffuse through a region—for instance, successful anti-regime protests in Egypt and Tunisia in 2011 triggered protests and unrest throughout the Middle East [@BamertGilardiWasserfallen:2015]. In particular, coups—either resulting from protests or military intervention—represent the worst-case scenario for autocrats working to maintain stability, as they *force* an irregular exit from power. According to data from @GoemansGleditschChiozza:2009, in the 100 countries I identify as autocracies, 790 executives have left office since 1950. In 240 cases, or nearly one third of all exits, the exit from office occurred irregularly (i.e. not due to term limits or natural death). A clear majority of these irregular collapses of executive power—182, or 75%—occurred as a result of military, political, or rebel coups. Coups are thus a notable threat for autocrats hoping to remain in power, and seeing coup activity in neighboring countries likely alters a regime's stability-maintaining calculus.

The second most common reason for unplanned autocratic exit is forced removal due to popular protest, seen in 21 cases—nearly 10%—of all irregular exits. While protests do not always lead to abdications of power, they can *threaten* to do so. Protests in neighboring countries are also a salient threat to stability, since, as seen during the string of revolutions and uprisings in the Middle East beginning in 2011, popular protests have a tendency to spread [@Kuran:1995; @Kuran:1989; @BamertGilardiWasserfallen:2015; @PatelBunceWolchik:2014]. Thus, regimes wary of the destabilizing influence of events outside their borders will attempt to insulate and protect themselves and change how they regulate domestic actors, leading to the following testable implications:

> **H~2a~**:  As domestic political instability increases in neighboring countries, the *more* autocrats restrict the regulatory environment for civil society at home

> **H~2b~**:  As coup activity in neighboring countries increases, the *more* autocrats restrict the regulatory environment for civil society at home

> **H~2c~**:  As popular protests in neighboring countries increase, the *more* autocrats restrict the regulatory environment for civil society at home

Finally, governments are not immune to outside influences. A growing body of research shows that states are quite concerned with their international reputations, and condemnation, shaming, and public pressure from abroad can induce changes in domestic policies [@Keck:1998; @Burgerman:2001]. Public reports and rankings issued by INGOs and governments can often have a direct effect on policies: studies have found that countries are more likely to criminalize human trafficking in response to the US State Department's annual Trafficking in Persons report [@KelleySimmons:2015; @Kelley:2017], more likely to undertake reforms that improve the ease of doing business in their countries [@KelleySimmonsDoshi:2017], more likely to conduct fair elections when monitored by foreign organizations [@Kelley:2012], less likely to receive foreign direct investment when condemned by INGOs [@BarryClayFlynn:2013], and more likely to respect human rights when cajoled and censured by INGOs [@Murdie:2012; @Murdie:2014a]. 

Anecdotal evidence shows that regimes also care about how their civil society regulations are perceived internationally. For example, as the government of Kazakhstan mulled over a more restrictive NGO law in 2005, US diplomats met with Kazakhstani officials and used the specter of international reputation to argue that "the best way for Kazakhstan to distinguish itself from its neighbors" was to respect international and domestic institutions, conduct fair presidential elections in 2006, and not pass the NGO law [@05ALMATY1938a]. Kazakhstan caved to the pressure and did not pass the law. In fact, promoting and maintaining their international reputation continued to be a strong driver of Kazakh policy thereafter. Throughout the mid-2000s, Kazakhstan worked to attain chairmanship over the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE), with the explicit hope of showing off its "high international reputation," and the country received the position in 2010.[^11] This leads to my final hypothesis: 

> **H~3~**:  As international shaming and condemnation of a regime increases, the *less* autocrats restrict the regulatory environment for civil society


# Data and methods

To test these hypotheses, I construct a new time-series, cross-sectional dataset of 100 autocracies from 1991–2014, compiling a set of variables from several well-established and new data sources. Most importantly, I offer a new index for measuring the overall level of de facto restrictiveness of a country's Civil Society Regulatory Environment (CSRE).

## Integrating mixed methods with nested analysis

There are important differences in how dictators regulate domestic and international civil society. When dealing with *domestic* institutional challengers, dictators have a wide array of policy choices to manipulate and control their influence, ranging from formal legislation against certain activities to imprisoning and torturing recalcitrant legislators, judges, or activists. Autocrats have fewer options for controlling *international* actors, however, because of issues of jurisdiction, diplomacy, and global politics. While it may be relatively easy for a dictator to harass and imprison the family of a native activist, attempting to jail or torture international advocates or aid workers is far riskier, as foreigners often have the legal and political backing of their home states. Dictators have a more limited menu of policy levers for controlling INGOs.

That said, at a legal and administrative level, the laws that govern civil society tend to cover both domestic and international organizations, and regulations that are applied to international NGOs are often the same as those applied to domestic NGOs. With a few notable exceptions, regimes rarely craft legislation aimed primarily and exclusively at regulating *international* NGOs. Accordingly, there is unfortunately no systematic way to quantitatively disentangle the application of the civil society regulatory environment to domestic and international organizations. 

Measuring the determinants of *international* NGO restrictions, then, poses a methodological challenge—despite a host of cross-national data on autocratic institutionalization, no existing measure fully reflects the regulatory environment for INGOs. I address this challenge by employing nested analysis, an innovative research design strategy that tightly integrates large-*n* statistical work with detailed small-*n* case studies [@Lieberman:2005]. 

Nested analysis differs from the more classical mixed methods research strategy proposed by King, Keohane, and Verba [-@KingKeohaneVerba:1994]. At its core, this more classical approach combines regression results and case studies to triangulate a theory's causal effects, answering the same empirical question multiple times with multiple methods and confirming (or disproving) the findings of the quantitative analysis. In contrast, nested analysis is a form of integrative multi-method research and is part of the qualitative methodological movement succeeding King, Keohane, and Verba [@Mahoney:2010; @WellerBarnes:2014; @Seawright:2016]. The underlying logic in this type of research is integrative rather than triangulative. Instead of seeking convergence in the results of quantitative and qualitative work, there is a clear division of labor between the two methods. With an integrative design, a study answers an empirical question once using multiple nested methods to investigate different aspects of the underlying theory. The nested design allows for a sort of iterative folk Bayesianism [@McKeown:1999], since the prior hypotheses analyzed in the large-*n* analysis inform the posterior small-*n* case studies; hypotheses that are proven correct (or incorrect) with statistical modeling are investigated further with deeper qualitative analysis.

In the large-*n* analysis presented in this paper, I test the robustness of my hypotheses using parsimonious models with minimal controls. Here I am less interested in precise effect sizes and more concerned with the overall trends of the various hypotheses and the predictive performance of the model I construct. In a separate paper,[^12] I use the results from this large-*n* model to help inform the selection of three cases—Egypt, China, and Russia—for more intense analysis of my hypotheses and theory. The statistical findings of this this directly inform the qualitative work that follows, answering different aspects of the same question. That is, I qualitatively study the regulation of *international* NGOs in a *handful* of authoritarian regimes within a larger quantitative analysis of *all* NGOs in *all* authoritarian regimes. 

## Dependent variable

### Measuring civil society restrictions

Empirically measuring the severity and extent of civil society legal restrictions is difficult. Scholars have used a handful of measures, including the CIVICUS Civil Society Index (CSI),[^13] the Global Civil Society Index (GCSI),[^14] global and regional public opinion surveys, and the CIRI Human Rights Data Project,[^15] but each of these variables faces substantial issues with scope, validity, and consistency. 

The CSI evaluates domestic civil society structure and values using country experts' opinions regarding four dimensions,[^16] scores each dimension on a 1–3 scale, and provides a final summative index—countries with a higher score ostensibly have a stronger civil society sector. However, CSI data has been collected in a few 2–3 year waves in only 30–50 countries, and has not been updated since 2012, making it difficult to use in annual cross-sectional analysis. In 2004, the Johns Hopkins Center for Civil Society Studies created the GCSI as a rival index. Similar to the CSI, the GCSI rates civil society along three dimensions[^17] and provides a final summative index to represent the strength of a country's civil society. However, the GCSI has not been updated since 2004, and it only includes a handful of non-OECD countries, which makes it unsuitable for studying civil society in authoritarian regimes. 

Scholars have also used public opinion surveys such as the World Values Survey (WVS)[^18] or regional projects like the Arab Barometer,[^19] Afrobarometer,[^20] and Asian Barometer[^21] to measure and analyze individual perceptions of associational life and participation in domestic and international NGOs [@Jamal:2007; @Bernhard:2007]. However, these surveys are not conducted annually[^22] and, like the CSI and GCSI, are not suitable for large-*n*, country-level analysis. 

Finally, the CIRI Human Rights project provides indices of human rights restrictions based on close readings of annual US State Department *Country Reports on Human Rights Practices* [@CingranelliRichardsClay:2014]. Among the rights measured by CIRI is a measure of the restrictions on the freedom of assembly and association, or how easily citizens can participate in trade unions, cultural organizations, or domestic and international NGOs. Countries can receive one of three scores each year—severely restricted, limited, and unrestricted—based on the severity and universality of civil society restrictions within each country. CIRI data is available for nearly 200 countries annually since 1981, making it ideal for cross-sectional analysis. However, with only three possible outcomes the data is sluggish and not granular, and it fails to pick up on slight changes in the regulatory environment.

### The Civil Society Regulatory Environment (CSRE) Index

These difficulties with data quality are not limited to civil society measures—many democracy-related indicators, including elections, judicial independence, and legislative activity, have spotty and inconsistent coverage over time and are not always reliable. A new project—the Varieties of Democracy (V-Dem)—however, attempts to address these issues. V-Dem uses a sophisticated Bayesian measurement model to aggregate existing published data and opinions from more than 2,500 country experts to provide hundreds of robust democracy-related indicators and indexes. Most importantly, in contrast with the CSI, GCSI, public opinion surveys, and CIRI, V-Dem indicators are available for most countries from 1900–2015 and display variation over time. 

V-Dem includes many variables related to the regulatory legal environment for civil society, including measures of entry and exit regulations, repression, participatory environment, and the level of women's participation in associational life. Scholars associated with V-Dem used these indicators to generate a Core Civil Society Index (CCSI), which measures the strength of civil society in a country given (1) the organizational environment for civil society organizations and (2) the level of citizen activism [@BernhardTzelgovJung:2015]. Following this lead, I construct my own Civil Society Regulatory Environment (CSRE) index to measure only state constraints on civil society, ignoring citizen participation in associational life, based on the CCSI's indicators for civil society organizational environment: (1) the level of state repression of civil society organizations and (2) the level of state control over civil society organization entry and exit into public life. The CCSI was constructed by aggregating several V-Dem variables using Bayesian factor analysis; for the sake of simplicity, my CSRE index uses only a sum of the relevant V-Dem indicators.

While V-Dem's unique combination of Bayesian modeling and detailed expert opinion makes the CSRE index arguably more robust and reliable than any single measure, it also means that the index is more difficult to interpret, as it is essentially a sum of scale-less vectors of model point estimates. @fig:csre-top-bottom provides some helpful context for understanding this index, showing the average environment index for the five highest and lowest autocracies from 2000–2014. The index ranges between roughly −6 and 6, with more repressive countries receiving lower scores—the average index score for autocracies is 0.3, while democracies average 3.7.

![Mean CSRE for five highest and lowest autocracies from 2000–2014](../../Output/figures/1-csre-top-bottom){#fig:csre-top-bottom}

To test the validity of the CSRE, I compare it with data that tracks the *de jure* regulations on NGOs in dozens of countries. Newer research on NGO regulations has taken a different approach to measuring restrictions on civil society—instead of using country reports, public opinion surveys, or expert opinion to measure the general environment for civil society, scholars have begun to hand-code all legislation aimed at regulating or restricting specific aspects of NGO operations throughout the world. @DupuyRonPrakash:2014a and @ChristensenWeinstein:2013 have each collected remarkable data on regulations aimed at restricting *domestic* NGOs from registering, receiving foreign funding, or engaging in advocacy, noting the specific bills, decrees, and constitutional laws that prohibit these activities. These databases of legal restrictions are not as comprehensive as the data available from V-Dem: Dupuy, Ron, and Prakash include foreign funding restrictions in 45 countries from 1993–2012, while Christensen and Weinstein include funding, registration, and advocacy regulations in 98 countries from 1909–2012.

![Relationship between types of NGO legal barriers and the CSRE](../../Output/figures/1-csre-dcjw){#fig:csre-dcjw}

Because the data collected by Dupuy, Ron, and Prakash only includes one measure of civil society restriction for a smaller subset of countries, the relationship between their data and the CSRE is non-existent. However, as seen in @fig:csre-dcjw, Christensen and Weinstein's count of legal barriers for NGOs is negatively correlated with the CSRE and fits with the logic of the index. In most years, most countries tend to only have a minimal number of formal laws limiting civil society activity and, as shown by the superimposed locally weighted average curves, moving from no barriers to one barrier only decreases the CSRE marginally, since it is likely normal for governments to assert some sort of legal control over NGOs. But as the number of formal barriers increases beyond a minimal regulatory regime, the CSRE steadily worsens. The form of legal restriction appears to have differential effects on the overall regulatory environment. [@tbl:csre-dcjw-coefs] lists the coefficients from a simple linear model predicting the CSRE based on the number of legal barriers. The addition of any anti-NGO law predictably worsens the overall legal environment, but imposing barriers to advocacy appears to have a greater influence than advocacy or entry, most likely because such laws target a subset of NGOs that pose more of a potential threat to regime stability. The CSRE measure is correlated with the imposition of formal legal barriers to NGO activities, as expected, given that de facto NGO restrictions are enabled by de jure regulations. The CSRE has an advantage over a strict count of laws, though, since it captures volatility in how those laws have been enforced over time. The CSRE index is thus a valid—and arguably richer—measure of NGO restrictions.

## Explanatory variables

### Identifying autocracies

I use two different methods to identify autocracies. First, I use the Unified Democracy Score (UDS) scale to capture country-level democratization. Scholars have long used data from the Polity IV project [@MarshallJaggers:2014], which assigns democracy scores ranging from −10 to 10 and categorizes countries into one of three regime types based on those scores: autocracies (−10 to −6), anocracies (−5 to 5), and democracies (6 to 10). Though these categories of democratization are useful at large magnitudes (i.e. there is a clear difference between a country that scores a −8 on the Polity IV scale and one that scores a 6), marginal changes in democratization scores are often meaningless (i.e. a change from a level 5 anocracy to a level 6 democracy is rather imperceptible and more susceptible to rater subjectivity). The UDS scale was created in 2010 to address the uncertainty inherent in measuring democratization [@PemsteinMeserveMelton:2010]. This scale uses Bayesian estimation and simulation to generate aggregate democracy scores based on 10 other standard measurement scales (including Polity IV). Instead of assigning each country a single score, the UDS provides every country-year with a posterior score distribution ranging from −2 to 2, with more democratic nations receiving higher scores. For the sake of analytic simplicity, I use a cutoff point of zero to roughly classify countries as democracies and autocracies, resulting in 86 authoritarian regimes.

Classifying regime type with an arbitrary numeric threshold is convenient, but can lead to substantial analytic issues. In their research on autocratic breakdown, @GeddesWrightFrantz:2014 found that in previous studies on autocratic breakdowns, using Polity thresholds as a proxy for autocracy overestimated predictions of regime survival by 100 percent, indicating that Polity's parsimony and simplicity fails to capture the nuances of autocratic rule. Accordingly, I also identify autocracies using data from @GeddesWrightFrantz:2014, who categorize 154 countries as various varieties of autocracies, including oligarchies, monarchies, and various combinations of personal, party, and military rule. 

These two approaches to identifying regime type yield slightly different categorizations—there are 89 countries with UDS scores below zero and 86 countries labeled as autocracies by Geddes, et al. To address this discrepancy and find the widest possible definition of autocracy, I include all countries that appear in either dataset, resulting in 100 states.[^23] For the sake of completeness, I consider a country to be autocratic if it has ever been categorized as such since 1991, meaning that countries that democratize or backslide are included. 

### Domestic conflict and regime cohesion

I hypothesize that political stability and internal regime conflict predict restrictions on civil society. I measure two sources of regime stability: domestic political stability and government cohesion. First, I use data from Political Risk Services' International Country Risk Guide (ICRG) to measure the internal risk and stability of a regime [@Political-Risk-Services:2014]. ICRG provides a monthly political risk rating for 143 countries based on a weighted collection of indicators, including government stability, corruption, ethnic tensions, and conflict.[^24] Risk ratings range from 0–100, with the most stable countries receiving the highest scores, and the most unstable countries ranking around 30–40. As I am interested in *domestic* regime stability, I omit the subcomponent of the score measuring external conflict, and to avoid issues with collinearity, I omit the subcomponent measuring democratic accountability, since I use other indicators of democracy, explained below. Having removed these subcomponents, I rescale the risk score to have a maximum of 100 to generate a final internal political risk index.[^25] Finally in the interest of clarity, because the term "risk" carries negative connotations and the ICRG risk index increases as stability improves (i.e. as a country's risk score improves, political conditions improve), I redefine domestic political *risk* as domestic *political stability*. Second, I use the ICRG subindicator for government cohesion on its own, as it captures instability within the ruling regime itself.

![Changes in ICRG domestic political stability and government cohesion indexes over time](../../Output/figures/1-icrg-examples){#fig:icrg-examples}

To demonstrate how shifts in domestic political stability and government cohesion are actually represented, @fig:icrg-examples shows these values for three authoritarian states: Qatar and Somalia, which have the maximum and minimum values of stability, respectively, and Syria, which has seen the most volatility. In the 10 years prior to the Syrian war, the country dropped 10 points in its domestic stability score, representative of a slow deterioration and stagnation of internal stability. Syria's government cohesion during this time remained relatively high and constant, however. From 2010–2014, the country dropped nearly 20 points in domestic political stability, and its government cohesion dropped to roughly the same level as Somalia. Few countries have seen such dramatic and precipitous drops in stability scores—in general, across all autocratic states between 2000–2014, the average difference between minimum and maximum domestic stability scores was 10.6 and the average difference in government cohesion scores was 3.7. 

Beyond aggregate regime stability, I include several variables directly related to domestic political institutions. I measure how many consecutive years the executive has been in office with data from the World Bank's Database of Political Institutions [@BeckClarkeGroff:2001], which indicates the longevity of the regime. I also include measures of regime competitiveness. Using data from the National Elections Across Democracy and Autocracy (NELDA) project [@HydeMarinov:2012], I calculate the number of years that have passed since a country held a competitive election. Following @DupuyRonPrakash:2014a, I consider an election competitive if opposition parties were allowed to participate, if more than one political party was legal, and if the ballot provided voters with a choice of candidates. I also count the vote share won by the largest opposition party, as measured by the Database of Political Institutions [@BeckClarkeGroff:2001].

### Stability of neighboring countries

I also hypothesize that external stability affects civil society restrictions within states. That is, when a regime observes general instability, coups, and popular protests in nearby countries, it will crack down on associational life and increase restrictions on civil society in an effort to minimize domestic institutional dissonance. I measure a country's exposure to external risk and conflict using the 0–100 domestic ICRG political stability score (described above) of all other countries weighted by distance.[^26] Weighting risk by distance permits me to assume that the level of internal stability in countries closest to a given state has the greatest bearing on that regime's behavior, while also allowing for more distant unrest to influence a regime's decisions. 

To supplement the more general measure of ICRG stability, I include data on the number of coups and popular protests in neighboring countries. I measure the level of coup activity by counting all successful and unsuccessful coups in a state's neighbors in each year [@PowellThyne:2011]. I define a country's neighbors to include all states within 900 km of the closest border, rather than including only states that share a contiguous border [@Gleditsch:2002]. I do not use the overall weighted average of coups, assuming that coup activity in distant states has little effect on a given regime (i.e. coups in Sierra Leone are not likely to worry officials in Tajikistan).

In contrast to the readily available (and more easily countable) data on coup activity, measuring protests is more difficult. In an attempt to quantify global protest activity, I use event data methods to construct new measures of violent and nonviolent protests in a given state. Event data uses computational natural language text algorithms to parse a text and determine *who* did *what* to *whom* *where* and *when*. After feeding millions of news media stories into this algorithm, the resulting data identifies the main actors, actions, and locations in a story, and can be used to track any number of events of interest. I use event data from DARPA's Integrated Conflict Early Warning System (ICEWS),[^27] which tracks more than 14 million events from 1995 to 2016 and includes nearly 180,000 instances of both nonviolent and violent protest across the 100 autocracies I have selected.[^28] 

However, using these events in a statistical model is not a straightforward task. Because media reports form the foundation of ICEWS, event data is by nature biased by the quantity of media coverage. Using a raw count of events in each country is not possible, since larger, more covered countries will inherently see more events. Conversely, dividing the count of events of interest by the total number of events in a country to create a percent-based index results in a measure that is biased towards less-covered countries. For example, ICEWS records only two events in Barbados in 2015, one of which was a nonviolent protest, meaning that a simple ratio would show that half of all events that year were protests. 

Instead of using counts or ratios, I generate a standardized measure by centering and rescaling the count of events of interest in each country over time, resulting in a variable that ranges roughly between 1 and 5—a value around 1 indicates that a country experienced fewer events of interest in a year than what they typically see, while a 5 indicates that it experienced far more than normal.[^29] @fig:protests-egypt-china provides an example of this rescaled measure, showing absolute and relative protest activity in both China and Egypt. China's low and steady hum of nonviolent protests remains roughly constant over the time period, with a spike in 2008 due to both the Tibetan uprising and the Olympic games. Violent protests peaked in 2012 due to ongoing tensions in Tibet and nationwide anti-Japanese protests. The standardization process scales both of these peaks to roughly five. A similar pattern occurs in Egypt, with a small uptick in protest activity in 2005 due to the country's first competitive presidential election, and a significant spike during the Arab Spring in 2011–2013. Though the counts of events are not comparable between the two countries, the standardized measure can be used across countries, showing here that the rapid increases in protests were indeed unexpected. 

![Protest events in Egypt and China—raw counts and standardized index](../../Output/figures/1-protests-egypt-china){#fig:protests-egypt-china}

As with the general ICRG-based measure of neighbor instability, I calculated the distance-weighted average for protests, since the reverberations of protests can be felt further off. Whereas a regime observing a faraway *coup* will not likely worry as much about contagion, the costs of participating in *popular protests* are generally lower than outright revolution and media coverage of foreign protests is more readily available, thus increasing the likelihood that dissidents will protest against the government.

### International shaming

Finally, I argue that reputational concerns influence an autocrat's decision to regulate civil society. Notably, this hypothesis only accounts for reactive condemnation, or shaming that *succeeds* a regime's violation of international norms. In the previous example of Kazakhstan, reputation was wielded preemptively and *preceded* (and possibly prevented) a norm violation. Detecting preemptive reputational shaming, though, requires access to documents and data that are generally impossible to find. @Kelley:2017 creatively relies on the 2009 Wikileaks dump of US State Department cables to trace the US's behind-the-scenes preemptive shaming in its global fight against human trafficking. However, locating instances of NGO-related shaming in Wikileaks cables is more difficult, especially given that the global crackdown on civil society began in earnest after Chelsea Manning had leaked her cache of documents. Additionally, as discussed previously, a growing body of research has shown that countries adjust their behavior in response to international shaming. In these studies, shaming has typically been tied to specific reports, scores, and rankings issued by states, IGOs, and NGOs regarding specific policy issues. Unfortunately, however, no country, IGO, or NGO publishes any index related to civil society repression. 

Since I cannot measure international shaming related to regimes' treatment of civil society specifically, I generate a more general measure that captures the overall level of international condemnation faced by a country. Previous research on media and politics has identified a "CNN effect" where increased international coverage of humanitarian disasters can encourage states to intervene [@Robinson:2011]. @MurdiePeksen:2014 find a similar effect for INGOs and use event data to show that more conflictual events between INGOs and states raise the likelihood for armed foreign humanitarian interventions. Under the assumption that heightened media coverage of international condemnation represents a more general form of shaming, I identify roughly 80,000 events in ICEWS where a state source condemns a state target in the 100 countries identified as autocracies.[^30] As with the measures of protest activity in neighboring countries, I center and rescale the count of shaming events in each country, where 1 indicates less shaming than normal and 5 indicates substantially more.

## Modeling decisions

Instead of testing my hypotheses with frequentist null hypothesis significance testing (NHST), the standard statistical approach in much of the existing research on international relations and comparative politics, I estimate a series of Bayesian generalized linear models. I use Bayesian methods primarily because they yield more meaningful inferences [@Kruschke:2010; @Korner-NievergeltRothFelten:2015; @GelmanCarlinStern:2013]. Frequentist NHST analysis determines the *probability of the data* given a *null hypothesis* (i.e. $P(\text{data} | H_0)$), yielding results that are often unwieldy, phrased as the probability of rejecting the null if it is true. In contrast, Bayesian analysis determines the *probability of a hypothesis* given *the data* (i.e. $P(H | \text{data})$), resulting in probabilities that are directly interpretable, phrased simply as the probability that the hypothesis is true. Similarly, Bayesian analysis provides more interpretable measures of uncertainty. Given frequentist-estimated parameters, we can calculate a 95% confidence interval that indicates that if the data were generated several more times, 95% of the resulting confidence intervals would contain the true parameter.[^31] With Bayesian methods, uncertainty can be described with a credible interval, which simply indicates that we can be 95% sure that the true parameter is with that interval. Bayesian analysis is not a silver bullet for inference—the linear models I fit must still be well specified and fit standard statistical assumptions (i.e. homoskedasticity of errors, absence multicollinearity, etc.). However, the framework usefully provides a more interpretable set of results.

I use weakly informative prior distributions for each of the coefficient parameters, based on a Cauchy distribution with a location of 0 and a scale of 1. I obtain the posterior distribution of the CSRE with Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling and simulate values from the joint posterior distribution of the coefficient parameters.[^32] I use the medians of the simulated values from the MCMC samples as coefficient estimates, and use the 2.5% and 97.5% quantiles as lower and upper limits for 95% credible intervals. Finally, I declare an effect statistically significant if the posterior probability of being different from zero is larger than 0.95. However, I only discuss significance as a frequentist convenience. Because Bayesian models estimate the probability of a given hypothesis, there is no need to construct significance thresholds for rejecting null hypotheses. When reporting the probabilities for estimates, I provide the posterior probability that the estimate is greater than zero.[^33] For the sake of consistency, when estimates are below zero, I do not reverse the inequality sign, resulting in low probabilities.[^34] A completely null result would yield a *p*-value of 0.5; "significance" throughout this analysis thus lies in the tails (0–0.05 and 0.95–1). 

As discussed previously, I employ model-building large-*n* analysis (LNA), which entails parsimonious model specification with minimal controls. I lead the CSRE by one year in each model to capture the lagged effect of all dependent variables, and I include year fixed effects as the only control variable.[^35] While this is admittedly a rough and naive identification strategy, these models are ultimately meant to demonstrate the conjoint determinants of the civil society regulatory environment in general, and not a precisely estimated treatment effect. Again, these results inform and complement the model-building small-*n* analysis (SNA) in @Heiss:2017,[^36] where I explore each hypothesis in more depth.

# Results

@fig:coefs-bayes presents the estimates of two different model specifications. In the basic, most parsimonious model, I measure the effect of internal determinants using only domestic political risk and government cohesion measures, external determinants using only coups and protest activity in neighboring countries, and reputational determinants using the relative measure of international shaming. In the alternate model, I include additional measures of regime stability and longevity as internal determinants and a more general distance-weighted measure of neighbor instability. The full results of both models are included in [@tbl:results-basic] and [@tbl:results-alternate] in the appendix. Because omitting individual variables from the full model (e.g. removing only duration in office) has little effect on the direction and size of the coefficients, I include all measures of stability and cohesiveness in the complete model.

![Determinants of the civil society regulatory environment. Points indicate median estimates of β; error bars indicate 95% credible interval](../../Output/figures/1-coefs-bayes){#fig:coefs-bayes}

## Internal determinants

I begin by examining my first hypothesis—that autocrats restrict the regulatory environment for civil society more as they face more instability within their countries in general and within their regime specifically. In both model specifications, increased domestic stability is associated with improved scores in the CSRE in the following year, meaning that CSRE is less restrictive in more stable countries. For every unit increase in the rescaled domestic stability index, the CSRE increases by approximately 0.05 points, which is a small but potentially potent change, given that the stability index ranges from 0–100 and countries typically see more sizable changes in their stability over time. The left panel of @fig:int-pred demonstrates this cumulative effect visually, showing the predicted CSRE across the range of possible political stability scores, with all other model parameters held at their mean values. All else equal, by only varying domestic political stability, the CSRE can move from 0 to 3 (or vice versa, as stability decreases). There is therefore strong evidence in favor of H~1a~ ($P(\beta > 0) = 1$)—the CSRE is more restricted in countries facing instability and conflict, and conversely, civic space is more open and free in countries with greater domestic stability.

![(L) Predicted CSRE across range of possible domestic stability scores; (R) predicted CSRE across range of government cohesion scores and length of executive tenure. All model covariates held at their means.](../../Output/figures/1-int-pred){#fig:int-pred}

The model offers contradictory evidence for H~1b~, however. I had hypothesized that autocrats would restrict the CSRE as the internal cohesion of the regime deteriorated. However, across both specifications of the model, autocratic government stability is significantly and *negatively* associated with the CSRE in the following year, resulting in a decrease of nearly 0.2 ($P(\beta > 0) = 0$). That is, as a regime consolidates its power and internal unity, it does not, in fact, increase the space for institutional dissonance for civil society organizations. Instead, it appears that autocratic entrenchment and stabilization leads to a more restrictive regulatory environment. 

The three additional measures of regime longevity bolster this evidence. Executive tenure is significantly and negatively associated with civil society regulations, and for every year in office, the CSRE will decrease by 0.1 on average ($P(\beta > 0) = 0$). The number of years that elapse between competitive executive elections has a similar effect, decreasing the CSRE by nearly 0.05 each year, *ceteris paribus*. The right panel of @fig:int-pred shows the substantial effects of these coefficients, demonstrating the predicted CSRE across a range of possible government cohesion values for countries with executives in office for 2 and 30 years. Contra my hypothesis, the CSRE clearly worsens both when regime cohesion increases and as autocrats remain in office longer.

Finally, the share of votes won by the opposition party is associated with an improved CSRE ($\beta$ = 0.4; $P(\beta > 0) = 1$). This may indicate a degree of endogeneity in the model—autocratic regimes with more electoral competition are more likely to have better, more open civil societies, regardless of executive tenure—but it is still a useful indication of regime behavior towards institutions. In countries where institutionalization is encouraged or allowed (i.e. where opposition parties win elections), other institutions such as civil society benefit, while countries with minimal institutionalization are more likely to have executives with longer tenure and, correspondingly, more restricted civil society.

The results from the models have fascinating implications for the hypothesis. As expected, more domestic instability is indeed associated with a worse environment in the following year, a sign that dictators clamp down on institutional dissonance when facing domestic crises. Unexpectedly however, the CSRE tends to worsen as regimes become more cohesive and remain in power longer. While this goes against my hypothesis, it reveals insight into the importance of civil society as an institutional actor—civil society is possibly one of the first institutions to be jettisoned as autocrats figure out the appropriate level of dissonance. Because they have not yet consolidated their power or mastered the balance of domestic institutions, young, less cohesive regimes tend to allow for more institutional dissonance, working with parliament, holding more competitive elections, and allowing for more civic space. As I describe in chapter 3 of @Heiss:2017, the civil society regulatory environment in Egypt was more open and accessible in the early days of both the caretaker military government (SCAF) and President Morsi. As they consolidated their power and faced increasing domestic tension, though, both SCAF and Morsi were better able to move against civil society. SCAF did not raid Western NGOs until the end of 2011, after having invited these INGOs months earlier, and Morsi did not propose draft laws until near the end of his term. President Sisi, on the other hand, rode into power on a massive wave of popular and military support following Morsi's overthrow in 2013, and because his regime has been more cohesive from the start, he has regulated civil society more harshly already than either of his predecessors. Civil society therefore likely factors in a regime's stability-seeking calculus, but only in a more ancillary way—as regimes gain more internal cohesion and remain in power longer, they face less of a need to remain open to institutions with less political power and can thereby constrict the CSRE. 

## External risk

In my second hypothesis I propose that increased political risks in a state's neighboring countries are associated with a decrease in the CSRE in the following year. I test the effect of regional instability in two ways, using counts of coups and protest activity in the basic model with  a more generalized measure of neighboring instability in the alternate model. The ICRG political stability of a country's neighbors, weighted by distance, has a clear negative effect on the civil society regulatory environment in the following year, lowering the index by 0.04 points ($P(\beta > 0) = 0$) for every unit increase in average neighboring stability. While this effect is small, it again has a powerful cumulative effect, and countries experiencing wide swings in neighborhood stability are expected to open the space for civil society. The downward trend in the left panel of @fig:ext-pred makes this trend clear as the CSRE index drops. Notably, this finding goes contrary to H~2a~, showing that autocrats restrict the regulatory environment for civil society as political stability in neighboring country *improves*, not worsens. As with the effect of government cohesion and consolidation, autocrats again behave differently than anticipated, restricting the CSRE at home when they feel safe in the region. I explore possible reasons for this divergence below.

![(L) Predicted CSRE across range of possible distance-weighted overall risk scores, with and without coup activity; (R) predicted CSRE across range of possible levels of violent and nonviolent protest activity. All model covariates held at their means.](../../Output/figures/1-ext-pred){#fig:ext-pred}

The general ICRG-based measure of neighboring regime stability captures a range of possible sources of instability, including corruption, military involvement in politics, ethnic conflict, and civil wars. Under the assumption that different types of instability matter more to autocratic stability-seeking calculus, I hypothesize that coups and protests in neighboring countries have an effect on the CSRE. In both model specifications, coup activity is associated with an improved regulatory environment—the presence of an attempted or successful coup in a close neighbor increases the CSRE by approximately 0.5 in the following year ($P(\beta > 0) = 1$). The difference between the two lines in the left panel of @fig:ext-pred shows this effect, with countries seeing coup activity receiving higher predicted CSRE scores. Again, this finding goes contrary to hypothesized expectations, revealing the opposite of H~2b~—in general, autocrats *expand* the regulatory environment for civil society when there are nearby coups.

Protests in the region are correlated with the CSRE, but in different ways. In both model specifications increased relative violent protest activity in the region is negatively associated with civil society regulations, indicating that autocrats constrict the CSRE as they witness violent protests among their peer nations. More violent protests than normal results in a drop in the CSRE of roughly 0.2 ($P(\beta > 0) = 0.02$ in basic model; $P(\beta > 0) = 0.15$ in alternate model). Conversely, autocrats expand the environment when witnessing nearby nonviolent protests—unusually high levels of nonviolent protest activity in the region is associated with an increase in the CSRE of 0.5 ($P(\beta > 0) = 1$), roughly the same magnitude of change seen when there are coups. The right panel of @fig:ext-pred demonstrates the divergent effect of distance-weighted violent and nonviolent protest activity. These findings add some complexity to H~2c~, demonstrating that autocrats restrict the civil society regulatory environment in response to *violent* popular protests in neighboring countries, but expand that environment in response to *nonviolent* protests.

As with internal regime cohesion, autocrats behave differently than expected when facing external threats. According to the model, an average authoritarian regime does not generally restrict the civil society regulatory environment when facing regional unrest. The CSRE tends to be higher when there is more instability, more coups, and more nonviolent protests in neighboring countries. This phenomenon contributes a possible corollary to research by @Weiss:2014, who shows that China selectively represses and allows popular protests at home according to a balance of government needs. If protests are too costly to repress and risk turning against the government, the regime allows them to happen (albeit under a degree of supervision and control), thus allowing for a type of pressure valve [@Weiss:2014, 227]. Protests and popular unrest abroad are inherently impossible to repress—an autocrat in one country has little control over revolutions next door—and as such, autocrats allow for increased dissonance at home, including conceding more space for civil society and NGOs. 

Importantly, managing this pressure valve is dangerous. Weiss argues that viewing regime permissiveness as a pressure valve understates the danger that increased dissonance can pose to a regime stability-seeking calculus: "Valves can break," Weiss stresses, "with potentially disastrous consequences" [@Weiss:2014, 227]. In 2011, President Mubarak permitted greater civic space in the early days of the Arab Spring uprising and did not initially stop the mass protests, having just watched his Tunisian counterpart lose power in a coup. As the mix of institutional actors became more complicated and difficult to balance, though, his pressure valve strategy unravelled and he was forced to resign [@Heiss:2012]. The fact that the model shows that the CSRE is more restricted when there are violent protests (as hypothesized) potentially shows that autocrats are aware of the risks of using pressure valves—as long as neighboring protests are nonviolent, civic space at home can be permissive, but once protests turn violent, autocrats crack down locally to prevent the unrest from spreading and to stop the valve from bursting. The CSRE therefore again plays an important role in maintaining regime stability and longevity, but in manner more nuanced than predicted.

## Shaming

Finally, in my third hypothesis, I posit that autocrats expand the regulatory environment for civil society as international shaming and condemnation of their regime increases. The evidence for this hypothesis is inconclusive, however. In the basic model, an increase in relative state-based shaming is associated with a lower CSRE index in the following year ($\beta$ = −0.22; $P(\beta > 0) = 0$), suggesting that autocrats respond to shaming with additional restrictions. However, when accounting for regime-based characteristics such as time in office and the competitiveness of elections, this effect reverses, indicating that the CSRE improves in response to increased relative shaming ($\beta$ = 0.11, $P(\beta > 0) = 0.95$). Both effects are substantially different from zero, but they are not consistent across models. @fig:shaming-pred shows this uncertainty, with the CSRE alternately improving and worsening depending on model specification. Given these findings, there is no conclusive support for or against H~3~.

# Discussion

Civil society, both domestic and international, behaves as an institution within authoritarian regimes, and accordingly, is one of the many institutional challengers that dictators must control and balance to remain in power. In an effort to curb the potential destabilizing risks associated with civil society organizations, autocrats limit civil society through legislation and regulations. The severity and restrictiveness of this regulatory environment is likely a function of a regime's cohesion and domestic stability, the level of stability and conflict in a regime's neighboring countries, and a regime's concerns over its international reputation. The results of this large-*n* statistical analysis contradict many of my initial hypotheses, but they reveal important nuances in the determinants of institutional treatment of civil society as a strategy for maintaining autocratic stability. [@tbl:hypothesis-summary] summarizes each of the principal findings from this analysis.

Following my first hypothesis, autocrats should restrict civil society more in the face of instability at home. These basic models provide conflicting evidence for this assertion. Following H~1a~, the domestic political stability of a country is clearly positively associated with civil society regulations. States facing political, economic, ethic, and social crises and other direct threats to regime survival are more likely to crack down on domestic and international civil society, while states facing calmer domestic politics are more likely to make concessions to civil society and allow for more institutional dissonance. Internal government cohesion (H~1b~), on the other hand, plays a countervailing role in the calculus to restrict civil society. Regimes that are more unified, stable, and durable appear to have sufficient political capital to safely impose restrictions on civil society.

According to my second hypothesis, fears of contagion from instability in neighboring countries should lead an autocrat to restrict civil society. However, as autocrats witness political instability and violence in their neighbors, they have an incentive to make concessions to civil society and expand the regulatory environment for NGO activity. Coups (H~2b~), nonviolent protests (H~2c~), and general political instability (H~2a~) abroad likely encourage autocrats to permit increased institutional dissonance at home as a hedging mechanism or pressure valve, heading off the threat of contagion by allowing for more robust associational life. Conversely, as with internal regime cohesion, having more stable and safe neighbors appears to provide autocrats with cover to impose more restrictions on civil society. Finally, autocrats react to violent protests differently (H~2c~), as these likely represent a more immediate threat to contagion and a risk to the safety valve. While the influence of nonviolent protests abroad can be offset by permitting additional institutional dissonance at home, violent protests have a higher likelihood of leading to regime change and thus result in a more constricted regulatory environment. After coups in neighboring countries—the assumed endgame of violent protests—are a *fait accompli*, it appears that autocrats attempt to mitigate future diffusion by expanding the CSRE. 

Finally, there is no conclusive support for or against the hypothesis that concerns over international reputation influence the decision to expand or constrict institutional dissonance. Formal, high-level diplomatic shaming and condemnation from other states is not consistently associated with changes in the regulatory environment for civil society. This null result could indicate that international shaming truly has no effect on a country's CSRE, but it is more likely an artifact of the data. Susceptibility to shaming is subtle and difficult to detect. Preemptive shaming through diplomatic efforts are typically unobservable (except when leaked cables reveal them), and instances of reactive shaming to specific anti-NGO crackdowns are difficult to systematically count or measure.

While these findings provide strong statistical evidence for some of the institutional determinants of authoritarian civil society restrictions, other results run contrary to what I had hypothesized. Within a nested analytical approach, though, such contradictory findings are welcome and provide grist for deeper small-*n* case studies that investigate these hypotheses further—these correct (and incorrect) hypotheses allow for iterative folk Bayesianism [@McKeown:1999] by adjusting my prior beliefs for in-depth qualitative analysis that builds, rather than tests, the theoretical model. Before connecting these results to the larger argument of determining what influences a regime's decision to expand or constrict its civil society regulatory environment, we must first examine these divergent findings in paradigmatic cases of international civil society restrictions: Egypt, China, and Russia.[^37]

[^28]:	I use the machine-coded classification of events, or CAMEO codes, to identify protests, with *nonviolent protests* = general political dissent (CAMEO code 140), demonstrate or rally (141\*), hunger strike (142\*), strike or boycott (143\*), and obstruct passage, block (144\*), and *violent protests* = protest violently or riot (145\*).

[^29]:	Specifically, I transform the raw count of each variable of interest using the following: $\frac{\mathbf{x} - \mu_x}{\sigma_x} + \left \lvert \min \left (\frac{\mathbf{x} - \mu_x}{\sigma_x} \right ) \right \rvert + 1$. I thank Shahryar Minhas for this idea.

[^30]:	I include all events categorized with CAMEO codes 11\*, which includes accusations, disapprovals, criticisms, and denouncements. 

[^31]:	It is often tempting to interpret frequentist confidence intervals in a Bayesian manner.

[^32]:	I use Stan [@stan] through R [@rstan; @r-project] to generate 4 MCMC chains with 2,000 iterations in each chain, 1,000 of which are used for warmup. All chains converge; I assess convergence with visual inspection, and diagnostic plots are included in the dissertation appendix.

[^33]:	For example, $P(\beta_1 > 0) = 0.98$ indicates that an estimate has a significant probability of not being zero.

[^34]:	$P(\beta_1 > 0) = 0.02$ means there is a 2% chance that an estimate is greater than zero, or a 98% chance that the estimate is negative.

[^35]:	In the spirit of estimating as parsimonious a model as possible, I omit country fixed effects. I would also omit year fixed effects, but because time is built into the model (i.e. because the lag of the dependent variable is included as an independent variable), I account for year-specific with year fixed effects. The estimates from the following models are thus time-invariant averages across all countries.
