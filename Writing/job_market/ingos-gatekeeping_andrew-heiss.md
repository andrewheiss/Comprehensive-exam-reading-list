Since the 1990s, international NGOs have emerged as a cornerstone of global governance [@Lipschutz:1992; @AhmedPotter:2006] and have become increasingly active in authoritarian regimes. Autocrats, in response to internal, external, and reputational pressures, work to regulate and restrict the activities and programming of international and foreign-funded NGOs working their countries. These regulations and restrictions often force INGOs to make difficult organizational decisions. What determines when INGOs comply with legal restrictions, resist government intrusions into organizational practices, or pull out of the country entirely? More generally, how do INGOs adapt to their institutional context and what tactics do they use to stay in engaged in the countries they target? 

In this paper, I argue that INGOs are primarily motivated by their core vision and values, but that they must balance the pursuit of their missions with instrumental concerns such as fundraising, time, staffing, and collaboration. These concerns both limit and enable INGO activities—without substantial instrumental resources and programmatic flexibility, organizations are unable to carry out their mission, while too much emphasis on resource concerns distracts organizations from their core programming and reduces their effectiveness. 

Repressive governments have an incentive to limit the foreign influence of guest INGOs and mitigate their potential political risks. Governments can mitigate the risks of international NGOs by employing regulations designed both to filter out organizations before they enter the country and limit the scope of their activities once they establish operations. These gatekeeping laws are not designed to distort or capture INGO missions, but rather to create a less inviting, less tolerant practical operating environment. Gatekeeping laws are designed to make life difficult for INGOs, introducing barriers to registration and adding obstacles to effectively undertaking their missions.

In this paper, I use evidence from a global survey of INGOs to explore two forms of gatekeeping restrictions: entry laws that regulate the registration laws for INGOs, and program laws that regulate the content of INGO activities. I find that INGOs facing these kinds of restrictions are most concerned with maintaining their access to the country. The amount of regulatory pressure INGOs face depends in part on the contentiousness of their relationship with their host governments. Gatekeeping regulations do not typically impose large burdens on non-contentious INGOs, as government and NGO preferences are aligned. Non-contentious organizations will typically maintain a good relationship with the government, follow registration laws, and keep their programming within the legal bounds set by the government. Gatekeeping laws put more pressure on high contention NGOs in an effort to limit their potentially destabilizing effects. Organizations with more programmatic flexibility will find creative ways to work around these restrictions or continue their work from abroad. INGOs with more limited resources, on the other hand, are less able to defend against regulatory intrusions into their flexibility and face more difficult choices, often hiding from the government or ceasing their programs and exiting the country.

After investigating how respondents respond to gatekeeping regulations, I then look at two detailed case studies of international NGOs that have confronted repressive gatekeeping laws with diverging outcomes. Article 19—one of the most prominent freedom of expression advocacy international NGOs—has lobbied for improvements in expression rights in dozens of countries in the face of increasingly repressive laws, and in general, has successfully maintained its access to those countries. AMERA International, on the other hand, a small-scale INGO that provided legal advice for refugees living in Cairo, lost its access to Egypt because of uncertain registration laws and a more difficult practical operating environment. I conclude the paper with a brief comparison of the two organizations' experiences.

# Data and methods: a global survey of international NGOs

Studying INGOs that work in authoritarian regimes poses a difficult methodological challenge. There is extensive cross-country research on the relationship between authoritarian regimes and *domestic* institutions like civil society [@FrantzKendall-Taylor:2014; @Kendall-TaylorFrantz:2014a; @FrantzEzrow:2011], as well as detailed case studies of individual authoritarian regimes [@Blaydes:2011; @Chen:2012; @Weiss:2013; @Teets:2014; @Hildebrandt:2013; @Brownlee:2007], and autocracies in general [@LevitskyWay:2010]. However, beyond newer case study work [@Teets:2014], little research has looked at how authoritarian regimes and *international* nongovernmental institutions interact.

Additionally, there is a dearth of structured data on INGO activities or behavior. These organizations publish a wealth of unstructured data, such as annual reports, budgets, press releases, or calls to advocacy, but few have systematically compiled these data sources into usable datasets. Existing research either relies on event data parsed from large corpora of news reports or highly specific in-depth case studies based on interviews and other unstructured data. Each of these approaches, however, pose methodological challenges. Event data often yields weak or uninteresting results since event data algorithms were originally developed to track wars and interactions between global elites—not NGOs—while case studies tend to be too focused on a handful of prominent organizations, resulting in findings and theories that are likely not very generalizable [@BloodgoodSchmitz:2013; @MitchellSchmitz:2014]. For example, human rights INGO research has thus far been primarily concerned with Amnesty International and other similar organizations, such as Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF), CARE International, or Oxfam [@Stroup:2012; @Wong:2012]. While there is utility in amassing thick descriptions of INGO activities, more must be done. @MitchellSchmitz:2014 argue that INGO case studies need to be combined with large, more representative analyses to better understand the organizations that work on specific issue areas as a whole. To this end, I examine INGO behavior by combining thick case study analysis with an online global survey of international NGOs that work in authoritarian regimes.[^1]

Complete technical details of the survey are available in an online appendix.[^2] I define an INGO as any organization that is not incorporated as a governmental entity or as a profit-seeking private firm that conducts advocacy, provides services, or otherwise works in at least *one* country other than the one it is headquartered in.[^3] Of the 17,590 organizations that potentially received an e-mail invitation to participate in the online survey, 537 completed the survey and 104 provided a partial (but usable) response. This yielded a participation rate of 3.8%, which is admittedly low, but similar to that found in other internet-based organizational surveys [@BaruchHoltom:2008]. The survey included 36 open-ended questions, and to give voice to these organizations, I quote extensively from these responses with minimal editing or correction. I guaranteed respondents anonymity to encourage candor in responses and to protect privacy. Accordingly, I assign each respondent a random four-digit ID number, and I strip all potentially identifying information from excerpts and quotes from their responses. I also anonymize any country-specific information, replacing references to country names with general regions (e.g. Ghana is reported as West Africa; Thailand is reported as Southeast Asia).

Those who filled out the survey were quite familiar with their organizations' work and had an intimate perspective of their organizations' experiences and strategies. More than half of the respondents indicated that they were the executive director, president, secretary general, CEO, or other high-level officer for their organization, and roughly a third were staff members or program officers, with the remainder either public relations officers or receptionists. Responding organizations span the globe and work on a wide variety of issues and policies. The sample of INGOs have their headquarters spread across 93 different countries (see @fig:hq-countries), with roughly two thirds based in either Europe or the Americas, primarily in the US, UK, and Switzerland (see left panel of @fig:work-hq-regions). 

![Countries where INGOs are headquartered](../../Output/figures/3-hq-countries){#fig:hq-countries}

![Regions where INGOs are headquartered vs. regions about which INGOs answered questions](../../Output/figures/3-work-hq-regions){#fig:work-hq-regions}

While comparatively few INGOs are headquartered outside the Global North, these organizations have a worldwide reach. In total, INGOs selected 169 different countries and answered questions about their work in 148. Organizations operate in a variety of political contexts. Unsurprisingly, given the concentration of INGOs in the Global North, the vast majority of respondents (90%) are headquartered in democracies. The countries these organizations work in, though, show more diversity in regime type—a third of respondents (219) answered questions about their work in autocratic regimes.


# What explains INGO responses to regulations?

Multiple mechanisms explain an INGO's response to government regulations. Below, I explore the tensions between core organizational principles and instrumental constraints and introduce the concept of programmatic flexibility, expanding work done by @MitchellSchmitz:2014 and other nonprofit management scholars. I also consider the overlap between organizational programmatic flexibility and a regime's regulatory environment, which constitutes the practical operating environment that INGOs must work within. 

## Core mission

An organization's foundational mission, vision, and values represent its ideal preferences. What exactly these values are, though, has been the subject of a decades-long debate over the role of NGOs in global politics. International NGOs were initially seen as a "magic bullet" for global governance: highly principled voluntary organizations that promoted human rights, alleviated poverty, provided needed services following disasters, and generally behaved altruistically under the leadership of well-intentioned mangers [@Reimann:2005; @Skjelsbaek:1971; @NyeKeohane:1971; @Bartelson:2006]. This overly normative conceptualization of INGO motives was called into question in the late 1990s and early 2000s, with research critiquing INGOs' lack of public accountability, potential for corruption, dependence on the financial support of governments they were designed to criticize, and emphasis on pursuing funding over mission [@HulmeEdwards:1997a; @HulmeEdwards:1997b; @Marzouk:1997; @BanksHulmeEdwards:2015; @Reimann:2005]. 

Building on these critiques, a new trend emerged that treated transnational actors as simultaneously normative and strategic [@Cooley:2002; @Keck:1999; @Kelley:2009a]. @MitchellSchmitz:2014 summarized this debate with their theory of nonprofit principled instrumentalism, or the notion that INGOs must balance their normative mission-driven principles against the instrumental needs of organizational survival. Unlike governments that work toward producing social value (such as maximizing national security or promoting general welfare) and unlike firms that focus on financial performance (such as maximizing profits for shareholders), nonprofit organizations face a tradeoff between their social mission and their need for resources and must pursue both concurrently—they must "instrumentally pursue their principled objectives within the economic constraints and political opportunity structures imposed by their external environments" [@MitchellSchmitz:2014, 489]. 

INGOs are motivated primarily by their foundational mission and values, and they structure their strategies around this vision to ensure that their programming furthers their mission [@Moore:2000]. In their landmark study of transnational NGO leadership, @MitchellSchmitz:2014 find evidence that organizations tend to focus principally on their core missions, and that concerns with money, fundraising, and other overhead, instrumental concerns are secondary. Organizations tend to ensure that their strategies align with and reflect their core missions, visions, and values.

## Programmatic flexibility

For Mitchell and Schmitz, organizations are primarily *driven* by their missions and *constrained* by instrumental concerns: worries about money and other resources get in the way of pursuing deeper normative principles. I argue, however, that this view of instrumentality is insufficient. Instrumental concerns, including time, money, or political connections, are not simply constraints. These resources are what allow INGOs to pursue their principled ideals in the first place—they provide organizations with the flexibility to engage in programming and adapt to the political and regulatory environments they face. 

Flexibility has a dual function. First, it is what allows an INGO to carry out its core mission. Programmatic flexibility is influenced by instrumental concerns, including an organization's size, diversity of funding sources, professionalization of staff, knowledge of the host country—essentially any resource-oriented strategy that permits an organization to implement its mission effectively in dynamic environments. This flexibility is also a function of organization norms—INGOs must be willing to use their instrumental resources to make appropriate adjustments to stay in the country. In some cases, an organization might have substantial income and highly professional staff, but will purposely choose to not engage in advocacy in a restrictive country because of its organizational vision or norms (i.e. its ideal point). The link between an organization's ideals and its flexibility represents a tension unique to third sector organizations. INGOs must balance their normative principles against the instrumental need of organizational survival. Nonprofit organizations must concern themselves with resources: ignoring necessary overhead concerns in favor of pursuing its vision will limit the organization's ability to effectively fund or carry out that mission (see @Moore:2000, 195). At the same time, the pursuit of flexibility is constrained by nonprofit norms. Dedicating too much time to expanding flexibility through overhead activities like fundraising, professionalization, and marketing can erode public trust in the organization.

Second, programmatic flexibility provides INGOs with a protective margin around their core missions, and their reserve of resources determines how effectively they can respond to different forms of government restriction and regulation. When host regimes constrict the allowable space for INGO activity and put pressure on their core values, organizations can respond by relying on their programmatic flexibility to make marginal adjustments to their non-core programming—organizations can marshal new resources, collaborate with more partner organizations, request the support of more powerful external actors, relocate their programs to other countries, or pursue other strategies to circumvent, mitigate, or otherwise reduce the impact of those constraints. The more flexibility an INGO has, the better they can adapt and the more creative and antagonistic they can potentially be; the less flexibility they have, the less so. 

## Contentiousness of INGO-government relationship

The distance between a host government's preferences for a given issue and an INGO's core vision for that issue determine how contentious their relationship will be. This distance, in turn, influences how governments attempt to regulate and oversee INGO work. The alignment of organizational missions and strategies with government preferences, therefore, is crucial for understanding government regulation of INGOs. Organizations working on issues that fall in line with regime preferences will be treated more favorably and with less regulatory pressure than INGOs working on more threatening, less aligned issues.

To analyze the favorability of INGO programming to government preferences, I divide the self-reported respondent issues into two levels of potential high or low regime contentiousness based on the potential compatibility of the issue with domestic politics in the host regime. In her work on democracy assistance NGOs, @Bush:2015 categorizes NGO programs according to their regime compatibility—activities that are highly regime compatible are those that "the target-country leaders view as unlikely to threaten their imminent survival by causing regime collapse or overthrow," as opposed to non-regime compatible programs that pose a more imminent threat [@Bush:2015, 60]. I follow a similar—though broader—definition when coding INGO contentiousness. While Bush accounts for the immediate political threat of democracy promotion NGO programming, I consider how regimes view NGO programming in the long run and how those activities fit into authoritarian calculations of stability. I code programming as highly contentious if it potentially targets government activities that are core to regime survival, thus posing a direct threat to autocratic policies and stability. As seen in @fig:issues-worked-on, highly contentious issues include human rights, advocacy, human trafficking, freedom of expression, conflict, and democracy assistance. Programming that aims to promote democracy, reduce government oppression, elevate anti-regime voices, or criticize human rights abuses has the potential to disrupt the balance of institutional challengers to regime stability.

![Issues INGOs work on the most, divided by potential contentiousness](../../Output/figures/3-issues-worked-on){#fig:issues-worked-on}

These highly contentious issues contrast with less contentious topics like education, development, health, and the environment. Governments are more willing to accept intervention and assistance in these areas because doing so poses less of a direct threat to regime stability and institutional balance. Providing a public platform for opposition leaders can empower rival institutions; digging wells typically does not. It is easier for a repressive government to improve its domestic reputation and offset institutional challenges to its political stability by embracing relief organizations, permitting community sport organizations, or partnering with health and environment INGOs. 

This categorization is by no means perfect. Education INGOs can pose a threat to regime stability as governments fear the spread of foreign influence among their youth, and development INGOs can rival weak central governments and create territorial "fiefdoms" to supersede the regime [@Schuller:2012]. However, while the division between low and high contention issues is fairly simplistic, it does appear to accurately capture (1) the broad types of programs that INGOs engage in, and (2) the range of possible objections governments are likely to raise (or not raise).

## Practical operating environment 

Even under favorable political circumstances, all nonprofit organizations—international NGOs included—walk a difficult tightrope between the dual pressures of mission and money. This balancing act becomes even more difficult when the institutional and political environments INGOs work to constrict, target, and limit their programming. Beyond financial and staffing constraints, a third of respondents indicated that domestic politics, laws, bureaucracies, corruption, and conflict also pose substantial burdens to their programming (see @fig:obstacles). Respondents note that they are limited by "shrinking civil space"[^4] and "increasingly restrictive laws in countries where our members operate"[^5] in the countries they target, by "[c]onstant attempts by public and private actors to restrict freedom of expression and media freedom"[^6] and by direct government interference in their activities.[^7]

![Main obstacles to INGO mission; multiple obstacles allowed](../../Output/figures/3-obstacles){#fig:obstacles}

Not all NGO-related laws lead to restrictions on activities, however. In work with Suparna Chaudhry, I find that the global increase in NGO laws is partly attributable to the routinization of NGO–government relations [@ChaudhryHeiss:2017; see also @BloodgoodTremblay-Boire:2016]. For example, governments may require NGO registration in an attempt to formally define their relationship with civil society, and those registration laws will not necessarily be burdensome. Data from @ChristensenWeinstein:2013 helps demonstrate this difference in restrictiveness. @fig:djcw-reg-regime shows the prevalence of NGO registration laws in 98 countries from 1990–2013. Roughly the same proportion of autocracies and democracies require that NGOs register, and both types of countries have increased this type of legislation at similar rates over time. However, far more autocracies make these registration laws burdensome, at a much faster rate. This suggests that there is an imperative to regularize state-NGO relations around the world, implying that the changes in laws that INGO respondents observe are not necessarily harmful. At the same time, there is a move to increase the burden of these more benign laws in autocracies, making it more difficult for NGOs to operate in these contexts.

![Proportion of countries with laws that require NGO registration and that impose additional burdens on the registration process, by regime type [@ChristensenWeinstein:2013]](../../Output/figures/3-dcjw-reg-regime){#fig:djcw-reg-regime}

Survey respondents confirm this. Nearly two-thirds of INGOs feel the most restricted and constrained by government regulations work in autocracies, compared to 25% of organizations that report facing no restrictions in similar regimes (see @fig:restriction-both).[^8] The relationship between host country regime type and feelings of restriction is quite marked, with the proportion of respondents working in autocracies decreasing steadily as the feeling of restriction decreases. Interestingly, there is not as clear of a relationship between the contentiousness of INGO programming and feelings of restriction. Half of highly restricted organizations work on contentious issues, but there is no significant difference between the other levels of restriction—roughly 25% of organizations that did not consider themselves highly restricted engage in contentious programming. It thus appears that the findings in @fig:djcw-reg-regime hold true—governments are increasingly passing routine NGO laws, but those laws are far more burdensome in autocracies where they are designed to restrict NGO activities.

![Feeling of restriction in host country, separated by regime type and issue contentiousness (cell heights represent proportion of responses; cell widths represent proportion of organizations working in regime type or on issue)](../../Output/figures/3-restriction-both){#fig:restriction-both}


The overlap of INGO programmatic flexibility and a government's de facto regulatory environment thus determines the practical operating environment for INGO activities, which in turn imposes additional constraints on these organizations. All nonprofit organizations face an internal conflict between mission and money, but nonprofits working as guests in repressive host countries are subject to regulatory vagaries linked to domestic political struggles. 

# Aims of government regulation

Understanding the mechanisms of the INGO-government relationship from the perspective of the INGO—including the conflict between mission, money, and the resulting practical operating environment—now allows us to explore how governments regulate INGOs, and more importantly, how INGOs respond to these attempts. 

Government regulation of international NGOs can be categorized into two general types—gatekeeping and program capture—each corresponding to an element of an INGO's theoretical behavior. Regulations focused on program capture are created (often explicitly) to encourage realignment of organizational missions and pull INGO missions closer to government preferences, thus creating a more cooperative relationship. I do not explore INGO reactions to program capture regulations here—for more details, see chapter 6 in @Heiss:2017.[^9] Gatekeeping regulations, on the other hand, are designed to limit the amount of programmatic flexibility an NGO can exercise, thus reducing the size of the practical operating environment and creating a less tolerant relationship. These regulations are not primarily intended to change how an organization runs. Instead, these laws impose barriers to entry—mainly through complex registration requirements—that give the government the ability to keep potentially destabilizing organizations out or to later revoke the permission of organizations that become politically dangerous after initially registering. Gatekeeping laws also limit the potential risks of INGO programming by establishing barriers to assembly, advocacy, and speech, prohibiting NGOs from engaging in undesired activities. According to survey respondents, gatekeeping regulations tend to take one of two forms: entry restrictions and program restrictions. 

## Entry gatekeeping: regulating registration

Registration is the form of regulation most clearly linked to goals of gatekeeping, and is one of the most common forms of government regulation of NGO activities—as seen previously in @fig:djcw-reg-regime, more than half of countries worldwide require that NGOs register with a government agency. NGO experiences with registration are mixed. More than two-thirds of responding organizations report feeling moderately or substantially affected by registration laws (see @fig:regs-faced-gatekeeping), and as expected, organizations working on contentious issues are slightly (though not significantly) more likely to face substantial restrictions:[^10] repressive governments place more pressure on organizations that are more likely to pose a political threat.

![Severity of gatekeeping regulations, divided by contentiousness](../../Output/figures/4-regs-faced-gatekeeping){#fig:regs-faced-gatekeeping}

However, feelings of restriction and actual registration are not necessarily linked—roughly half of respondents are *not* formally registered in their host countries (see top panel of @fig:registration-all), and there is no significant difference between the registration status of INGOs working either in autocratic regimes or working on contentious issues. Registration status is correlated, however, with organizations' overall perceptions of restriction (see bottom panel of @fig:registration-all). In both types of regimes, organizations that report not feeling restricted are the most likely to not be registered, while those that feel moderately restricted are the least likely to register. In the absence of strict registration laws, many INGOs can fly under the radar and avoid formal registration. For example, a development INGO in Latin America reports, "We're not registered… we just 'do our own thing'; so far the government has paid no attention to us in any way."[^11] As governments increase their enforcement of registration laws, INGOs feel more restricted and are more likely to be registered. However, the relationship between registration status and perceptions of restriction diverges for the most restricted INGOs. Organizations that report feeling the most restricted are just as likely to be registered as their unrestricted (and largely unregistered) counterparts, generally because it is exceptionally difficult and costly to formally register.

The experiences of responding NGOs reveals much about the effects of registration requirements on programming decisions. Organizations working in democratic contexts generally face little trouble in registering, noting that the process tends to require "just some formalities… [and] administrative work," such as submission of annual reports, board minutes, and basic financial statements to government authorities, which does not ultimately have any negative impact on their daily work.[^12] Those working in more difficult political environments shared differing experiences. Common complaints about registration dealt with its duration, cost, and arbitrary process. Organizations explain that "it takes a large number of steps to become registered [and] rules are not clearly articulated."[^13] INGOs working in highly autocratic countries like Cameroon, Congo, Ethiopia, Haiti, and Nigeria report registration processes that take 3–7 years to complete, days of travel to government offices in capital cities, and thousands of dollars in fees and side payments.[^14] Others also face arbitrary registration requirements invented by local officials, saying that "conditions have been added randomly on our NGO without any basis."[^15] In some countries, international organizations face a double registration requirement—an education INGO working in Latin America spent several years obtaining registration status only to discover that even with formal registration, they had to incorporate a domestic NGO to gain legal personhood and access to the banking system and courts, a process which took another four years.[^16] The bureaucratic bottlenecks do not necessarily end after this initial registration—a religious humanitarian services INGO working in the Caribbean spends at least three months every year working to secure annual renewal of that status, which imposes substantial administrative costs and causes delays in importing food and medical supplies.[^17] When facing gatekeeping restrictions like registration laws, INGOs use their programmatic flexibility to make marginal adjustments to their programming to maintain overlap with regime preferences. 

Often, no programmatic adjustment is needed—most low contention organizations already fall within with regime preferences and willingly comply with registration regulations without issues. One development INGO working in East Africa represents the experiences of many other organizations, reporting that "because [our organization] is supported and invited by the […] governments themselves, we do not have problems with the ability to pursue missions. Being invited means that we are welcome to operate and pursue each mission," and because of their clear overlap with government preferences, they are "in complete compliance … with these rules and regulations without falter."[^18]

When the distance between regime and INGO preferences is more distant and the relationship more antagonistic, INGOs use their flexibility and resources to act more creatively. Some organizations, for instance, seek out the friendliest and most amenable bureaucrats when registering or communicating with the government. A development INGO working in Oceania that was struggling to obtain permission to work in the country and import aid supplies stopped approaching ministry-level officials after repeated failure. Instead, they turned to local bureaucrats, who in turn obtained permission from their respective ministry heads.[^19] This workaround depends on the organization's programmatic flexibility, though, and is only possible with some knowledge of intragovernmental relationships—the INGO had to cultivate and understand those relationships over time in order to take advantage of them to expedite registration. 

More often, rather than creatively navigate the bureaucracy, organizations actively limit their contact with the government. It is important to note that this active avoidance of the government is different from the experiences of INGOs that are allowed to "do [their] own thing." In those cases, the preferences for both the government and INGO overlap and governments see no need to require registration or regular contact. In contrast, INGOs react with active avoidance when the government pulls back the civil society regulatory environment in an effort to control INGO activity. INGOs must wield and extend their flexibility to cope with this shift. Organizations will "avoid any contact with government officials"[^20] and work carefully to "reduce [their] visibility"[^21] in circumstances where registration and other gatekeeping rules are too restrictive, and respondents report that exceptionally strict regulations can drive INGOs underground and severely inhibit their ability to carry out their mission. 

Sometimes INGOs change their headquarters within their host countries in response to increased government scrutiny. One organization working in Southeast Asia moved its headquarters to a more remote part of the country after local authorities became aware that they were not fully compliant with all regulations, while others working in Eastern Europe and Central Asia relocated to avoid uncooperative and "not ethical" officials who decided that the INGOs were not compliant.[^22] Finally, some organizations—particularly those with more contentious missions—move out of the country completely and work in exile because of the arbitrary (and targeted) enforcement of registration requirements.[^23]

INGOs require sufficient resources and flexibility to engage in these strategies of active avoidance. Moving headquarters is expensive and time-consuming, and the organizations that report doing so tend to have more streams of revenue, employees, staff, or collaborative relationships than the average respondent. In general, in the face of increased regulations, organizations with more employees respond with a greater variety of strategies. @fig:reactions-size shows the proportion of survey respondents indicating they had made a change in how they implemented programs in their host countries, including moving in-country offices or changing the issues they work on. The proportions are divided by organization size, with six employees (the median value) as the cutoff between small and large organizations. For almost every strategy, larger organizations (i.e. those with more programmatic flexibility) are more likely to make adjustments. @tbl:reactions-size-p provides the difference in proportion of small and large INGOs making each adjustment. Notably, larger organizations are significantly more likely to turn to more local staff ($P(\Delta > 0) = 0.04$) and change the issues they work on ($P(\Delta > 0) = 0.01$), and fairly more likely to shift their funding sources ($P(\Delta > 0) = 0.12$) or change the locations where they work ($P(\Delta > 0) = 0.18$). Having more staff provides organizations with greater ability to make the changes needed to creatively adapt to changing regulations.

\newpage

An organization working in the Middle East illustrates the importance of having increased flexibility to deal with registration restrictions.[^24] The INGO provides humanitarian aid to refugees fleeing the Syrian civil war and their host government is hostile towards it. The organization reports that "they do not want us to operate there" and that registration is difficult. As a result, the INGO actively avoids any contact with government officials and flies under the radar as much as possible. Though hiding from the government puts the organization at risk for expulsion and forecloses officially sanctioned streams of revenue from government ministries, the organization is able to sustain itself legally and financially through connections to other larger IGOs and INGOs like the World Food Programme, the Red Crescent, and large American churches, which provide the INGO with substantial funding and legal support.

In contrast, a humanitarian aid INGO working in the Caribbean provides an example of how low programmatic flexibility limits organizational effectiveness under strict registration regulations.[^25] The organization is not officially registered with the government, which leads to difficult legal consequences. The respondent says:

> It is a very complex and lengthy process to register a foreign organization. It cost over $10,000 and many, many trips into the capital to complete. It meant that for our first 7 years of operation, we were not an official organization and could not purchase property or vehicles in the org's name.

In the absence of legal standing and access to the courts or property registration system, the organization keeps its programming hidden as much as possible and even avoids putting logos on their vehicles or advertising their work to the public. While the organization is able to fulfill its mission of improving health in rural communities, it feels held back by its precarious legal situation and is unable to scale up, fearing the legal ramifications "if we grow big enough where we can no longer fly under the radar." The respondent identifies low funding as the primary barrier to both emerging from the regulatory shadows and to scaling up its operations. With more opportunities for fundraising and grant writing, the organization would be able to register and find firmer legal standing, but the absence of these resources "is holding back growth." The organization has not shifted its core mission to become friendlier to the regime, but its lack of flexibility has relegated it to the margins.

Finally, INGOs can find other bureaucratic loopholes and remain engaged in the country while in exile. Stymied by a complicated registration process, an organization working in East Africa gave up and began funding local NGOs instead of opening an official office in the country.[^26] Another working in Latin America hires consultants who are nominally associated with the organization, allowing the INGO to ensure that they have no legal organizational presence in the country.[^27] Other organizations try to maintain some presence in the country, but outsource compliance with laws to domestic partners that are better positioned to stay on top of the changing regulatory environment. Another INGO working in East Africa explains "[w]e partner with a local NGO which handles the internal regulations,"[^28] while one in Central Africa maintains an office in the capital city staffed entirely by locals, allowing the organization to follow domestic labor, tax, and organizational laws instead of stricter regulations targeted at international organizations.[^29] Regulatory outsourcing can enhance an organization's flexibility, as local staff are best positioned to "know the law… and the practices (traditions, curruption to avoid, conflicts to not engage in, etc.) [sic]"[^30] At the same time, managing in-country operations from abroad is costly and requires significant time and resources to remain effective. Organizations with greater programmatic flexibility can successfully work from abroad, while those that struggle with small staff, few volunteers, or limited funding can falter. 

A human rights INGO working in the Middle East illustrates the importance of high flexibility when working from exile. The organization faces two layers of strict gatekeeping regulations. Because the target country has banned the international NGO from opening an office in the country, the organization remains in Europe and partners with member organizations based in the target country. Recently, though, their partner organizations have also been banned from working in their own country and now work in exile as well. This imposes significant costs on the organization and has made their mission far less effective. Repressive gatekeeping laws limit the INGO's domestic partner organizations' "access to information, their ability to protect victims of human rights violations in the country, and to engage in advocacy with the public of [their country], all of which of course affects [our] ability to do the same."[^31] Despite these substantial barriers, the INGO has been able to continue its work in the repressive country because of highly professionalized staff and consistent external funding—it receives donations from dozens of OECD countries and large foundations like the Ford Foundation and the Open Society Foundations. Though its target country severely limits the practical operating environment, the organization can draw on its programmatic flexibility to continue its mission.

Thus, because these laws are aimed at controlling access to the country, INGOs facing registration restrictions strive to maintain their access. INGOs that have a more cooperative relationship with their host governments generally do not face difficulties complying with these regulations. When the relationship is more antagonistic, INGOs react to stricter registration regulations by drawing on their programmatic flexibility to creatively confront the rules or avoid the government entirely, all in the hope of avoiding shifts in their core missions.

## Program gatekeeping: regulating assembly and speech

Registration laws are not the only mechanism for controlling INGOs. Once organizations are allowed in, governments can use laws that restrict freedom of assembly and speech to exercise gatekeeping power over the types of programs that are permitted. This allows governments to limit potential risks of foreign influence that could stem from INGO programming. Laws restricting assembly and speech are typically designed to prevent mass political and social protests, but these laws also affect many NGO programs, especially those of high contention organizations (see @fig:regs-faced-gatekeeping)—low contention INGOs are marginally more likely to face no program gatekeeping regulations, while high contention INGOs tend to face substantial regulatory pressure.[^32]

One INGO working in Southern Africa explains that "the government is security and politically conscious, and have a negative view to gatherings of people. They take gatherings as opportunities for political influence. … The government associates international NGOs with politics which is not entirely true."[^33] Organizations engaged in more contentious advocacy are especially prone to enhanced government scrutiny and fears of political influence. The majority of respondents who reported substantial or moderate difficulties with limits on assembly and speech work on contentious issues (see @fig:regs-faced-gatekeeping), but non-contentious organizations also get caught up in these additional restrictions. An organization in South Asia providing disaster relief downplayed government fears of the potential political influence of NGOs, condemning its host government's "hue and cry about foreign money and agenda with out any evidence."[^34]

The potentially political nature of INGO programming leads to stricter limitations on assembly. In a few highly repressive cases, there is a ban on all meetings, rallies, and protests,[^35] but such prohibitions are rare. Instead, respondents report that bureaucrats set the terms for the gatherings and grant or deny permission to meet. In most authoritarian countries, NGOs need police or government clearance to hold any public gathering or assembly.[^36] Activities must be pre-planned and demonstrably well organized, and even if all rules and regulations are followed, applications and permits can be denied or revoked arbitrarily and without explanation.[^37] INGOs also face restrictions on speech—a media development organization working in Eastern Africa has to receive ministry approval for all their scripts and training materials[^38] Even with permission to engage in speech or advocacy, there are still substantial risks: one human rights advocacy INGO working in Southeast Asia reported that ten of its members were arrested and imprisoned because they had participated in a peaceful political protest, despite the organization's formal registration status.[^39] 

How do INGOs react to and accommodate these restrictions? Again, because INGOs facing gatekeeping restrictions are most concerned with maintaining access to the country, organizations confront restrictions on assembly and speech by drawing on their instrumental resources and flexibility. However, unlike registration laws, which many organizations are able to skirt by flying under the radar and avoiding contact with the government, hiding more public activities like workshops, meetings, and rallies imposes heavier costs on organizations and carries a higher risk of punishment for noncompliance. As such, the majority of respondents lack the ability or will to marshal resources to challenge these laws and instead tend to comply with speech and assembly regulations and make their political neutrality quite public.

Organizations whose core missions do not involve large gatherings and protests actively eschew the appearance of politics: a human trafficking organization working in Southeast Asia noted that they "do not have problems with freedom to assembly since we are not engage in leftist activities [sic],"[^40] while a children's INGO in Eastern Europe sidesteps restrictions through the "simple use of discretion (avoid politically motivated gatherings) [sic]."[^41] Respondents also engage in frequent self-censorship to signal their benign intentions to their host regimes. Organizations are aware of "unwritten limitations to how much [their] advocacy work can go" and fear being seen as anti-regime, since crossing unstated government red lines encourages "government operatives [to] start looking for trivial faults as [a] way [of] shutting us up."[^42] Most INGOs "take care not to cross" these lines and pay deliberate attention to the phrasing of their public statements, avoiding any overt criticism of their host countries.[^43]

Similarly, organizations that are inherently more contentious—that cannot avoid the appearance of politics, or that offer public activities involving many participants—maintain access to the country primarily by following regulations regarding speech and assembly. Even many of the most contentious human rights INGOs attempt to obtain permits and official permission for their public-facing programming. For instance, in response to the arrests of its members and because of its inability to formally register in the country, the human rights INGO working in Southeast Asia changed how it trains its partners within that country and now communicates with activists online through Facebook Messenger and Skype.[^44] Other organizations make marginal adjustments to their programming to adhere to assembly laws without actually changing the core purpose of that programming. One organization implements its mission of teaching peace building and interfaith cooperation in countries facing religious and ethnic conflict by holding large-scale public events and workshops with thousands of attendees. Because speech and assembly laws in one of the Southeast Asian countries the INGO targets prohibit such events, though, the organization breaks these workshops into smaller, more frequent events, working with "hundreds, not thousands" at a time.[^45] 

INGOs are able to make these adjustments only when they have sufficient flexibility to do so. The human rights INGO in Southeast Asia works closely with European politicians and UN diplomats and has access to lawyers that can bring human rights abuse cases to local, European, and international courts. It also has the technical knowledge to help domestic activists access the internet safely, allowing for secure remote trainings and workshops. Similarly, the peace building INGO in Southeast Asia has sufficient money, time, and staff to host many small events in part because of its many collaborative relationships with several IGOs and large Western foundations. Without these resources, these organizations would not confront or adapt to the restrictions on assembly and speech and would struggle to maintain their access to their respective target countries. 

Thus, as with registration restrictions, INGOs facing assembly and speech restrictions are concerned primarily with maintaining access to the country. Confronting these laws, however, is more costly, risky, and not always necessary. When their core mission does not entail a political threat to the government, INGOs react by engaging in self-censorship or publicly demonstrating their political neutrality. When INGO programs are inherently political or are directly threatened by these regulations, organizations rely on their programmatic flexibility to avoid changing to their core missions.


# Article 19

INGOs with greater flexibility—that is, organizations that are larger, better funded, that collaborate with other organizations, and have close relationships with local government officials—should be best positioned to adapt to changing gatekeeping regulations. Programmatic flexibility is especially important for organizations that find themselves further from their target governments' ideal preferences. By relying on their instrumental resources, INGOs can maximize the practical operating environment of the countries they work in and remain in the country without making changes to their core principles. Survey respondents provided a useful aggregate view of how INGOs are both affected by gatekeeping regulations and how organizations rely on their flexibility to maintain access to their target countries. The experiences of Article 19 illustrate this phenomenon in greater depth.

## Mission and strategy

Article 19 was founded in 1987 by the children of American businessman and philanthropist J. Roderick MacArthur, who himself was the son of John MacArthur, a famous American philanthropist whose endowment established the Chicago-based John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation. The younger philanthropist was a champion of civil rights who "believed that foundations should be at the cutting edge of social change" [@Nielsen:1996, 132]. Before his death in 1984, he laid out his vision to establish an international organization to combat censorship [@Fein:1992]. Though he died before the organization was incorporated, his children provided a $500,000 seed grant and founded what has become one of the most prominent freedom of expression NGOs in the world.

The organization takes its name from the UN's Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which establishes that

> [e]veryone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression; the right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any media regardless of frontiers [@udhr:1948, art. XIX].

In its 30 years of advocacy work, Article 19 has been motivated by a clear vision, working toward a world "where people are free to speak their opinions, to participate in decision-making, and to make informed choices about their lives."[^46] The practical contours of this vision have evolved over time. In its early years, Article 19 litigated and lobbied for imprisoned journalists, but over time has expanded its mission to encompass advocacy for all speech and information. Today, its stated mission is to "work so that people everywhere can express themselves freely, access information and enjoy freedom of the press."[^47] The organization has a wide-ranging portfolio of programs that cover each of the three pillars of its core mission. First, a substantial portion of Article 19's attention is focused on protecting *individual expression*. The organization publishes research papers, issues statements, and releases advocacy letters that call on governments to maintain assembly and speech rights and discourage repressive regimes from passing laws to abrogate those rights. Article 19 also gets involved directly with litigation and lobbying, working with local lawyers to defend the rights of people imprisoned for self-expression and advising politicians and bureaucrats as they draft new laws to regulate expression. Second, the organization is concerned with ensuring *access to information*. Article 19 consults governments and lobbies for Right to Information (RTI) laws that guarantee access to public information and promote government transparency and accountability. The organization also advocates for progressive Information and Communication Technology (ICT) laws that guarantee access to the internet. Finally, Article 19 focuses on maintaining and promoting *freedom of the press*, again lobbying and consulting governments as they draft media laws, advocating for minimal press regulation, and shaming regimes that engage in violence against the press. The organization has had substantial success, setting international standards for freedom of expression and working directly with dozens of countries to establish and reform domestic laws regarding speech, assembly, and expression [@LandmanAbraham:2004, 32].

## Sources of flexibility

Repressive governments employ gatekeeping regulations to keep contentious INGOs outside of their countries or severely limit their activities within their countries. Article 19 has been successful in creatively adapting to the gatekeeping restrictions in the dozens of countries it targets because of its deep supply of programmatic flexibility. The organization's flexibility comes from multiple sources: reliable donors with deep pockets, regional offices located in stable countries near more repressive target countries, and dozens of professionalized staff with close connections to the government officials and bureaucrats best positioned to support freedom of expression-based legislative reform. 

Since its initial $500,000 grant from the J. Roderick MacArthur foundation, Article 19 has enjoyed a relatively steady flow of revenue. Though it accepts individual donations, the bulk of Article 19's funding comes from governments and large organizations. Roughly half of its income comes from various British government agencies [@Stroup:2012, 180], including the UK Foreign and Commonwealth Office, the UK's Department for International Aid (DFID), and British embassies. The remainder comes from other foreign governments—primarily Sweden and Norway—intergovernmental organizations like the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) and the European Commission, and large American foundations and nonprofits such as the Open Society Foundations (OSF), the Ford Foundation, the William and Flora Hewlitt Foundation, and the National Endowment for Democracy (NED). Article 19 has been able to maintain a relatively steady flow of revenue over time, shifting and seeking out new grants as needed. For instance, after 2004, funding from the Open Society Foundations dried up, but the organization was able to replace it with grants from the Ford Foundation [@Stroup:2012, 180]. In general, the organization has maintained a balanced or surplus budget, which has allowed it to expand its operations to a global scale (see top panel of @fig:a19-budget-staff).

![Article 19's income, expenditures, and full time staff, 2004–15](../../Output/figures/4-a19-budget-staff){#fig:a19-budget-staff}

More importantly than steady revenue, however, is the alignment of Article 19's vision with that of its donors. To avoid mission drift, the organization seeks out foundations that already have a history of funding freedom of expression and anti-censorship work, such as OSF and the Ford Foundation. Article 19 consults with its donors to ensure that their visions and missions align. This is particularly important for the type of legislative advocacy Article 19 engages in—lobbying is expensive, time consuming, and runs a high risk of failure, even in democratic political systems. Article 19 staffers noted that foundations looking for guaranteed quick returns on their social investments can lack the patience and flexibility to fund the organization's lobbying efforts. One compared the slowness of their work with the Polish Solidarity movement in the 1980s, which received funds from Western donors while making little visible progress in promoting human rights until the fall of communist rule in Poland. The staffer observed that Solidarity would not have existed had donors thought about the movement like they do today, with donor emphasis on results-based outcomes.[^48] Evidence from @Bush:2015 supports this view, showing that donors' increasing emphasis on professionalization and measurable results has led to a taming of confrontational democracy assistance programs. Accordingly, Article 19 seeks out donors with longer time horizons and more permissive standards of results to ensure that their programs are not tamed by donor demands.

Another key source of flexibility is Article 19's geographic proximity to the countries it targets. Since at least the early 2000s, Article 19 has divided its advocacy work primarily by region, assigning staff to portfolios of countries in Africa, Asia, Europe, Latin America, and the Middle East and North Africa,[^49] each overseen by an expert program officer. The organization also maintains issue-specific programs focused on law, operations, and digital advocacy,[^50] covering its work across all regions. Prior to 2005, beyond a few small regional offices in Latin America, most of Article 19's staff were based in London, with program officers traveling regularly to their assigned regions and communicating with implementing partners remotely. In 2004, under the direction of executive director Agnès Callamard, the organization established a 5-year strategic vision that included a goal to strengthen Article 19's global presence, starting by exploring options for creating permanent local offices in each region [@a19:2005, 41]. By 2007, that goal had crystalized into a more specific target of establishing "a presence in all five regions by 2010, including through posting of staff, opening of local/regional offices, and/or institutionalised partnership (franchise) with local NGOs" [@a19:2007, 18]. 

![Article 19's headquarters and regional offices](../../Output/figures/4-a19-offices){#fig:a19-offices}

Between 2007–08, Article 19 established four regional offices in Kenya, Mexico, Brazil, and Bangladesh. Regional offices were later established in Senegal and Tunisia, and the organization today has a nearly global reach (see @fig:a19-offices). Each local Article 19 office is governed by its own local board of directors that is charged with implementing the programs organized and proposed by the central London office. Article 19's regional offices are less independent than the country-based affiliates of other human rights advocacy organizations like Amnesty International, whose country offices have enormous implementation power and strategic latitude [@Wong:2012]. Article 19's organizational strategy is coordinated and overseen in London by its executive director and senior management team [@LandmanAbraham:2004, 30] and supported by a core of roughly 20–30 permanent staff members.

Article 19's expenditures by region, 2011–15
</div>

Beginning in 2013, under the leadership of its new executive director Thomas Hughes, Article 19's focus became substantially more global. The organization had previously spent the majority of its programming expenses on programs in Africa, with a peak in 2013 of nearly £1,000,000 (see @fig:a19-regions-expenses-abs). Since then, however, African spending has been reduced while programs in other regions have seen increased funding. Looking at the percent of money spent on regional programs highlights this shift more clearly. African programs had consistently accounted for roughly a third of all regional expenditures until the organization's global turn in 2013–14. By 2015, all regions received between 12 and 22 percent of the organization's expenses, with no clear outliers (see @fig:a19-regions-expenses-pct). Article 19's focus on global advocacy was made possible because of its network of regional and national offices. In conjunction with the normalization of its regional focus, Article 19 expanded its staff substantially between 2011–2013, quadrupling the number of full time employees (see bottom panel of @fig:a19-budget-staff) and spreading its new staff to its regional offices. More staff and regional experts deployed in national offices gives the organization increased access to government officials, enhances their ability to lobby governments, and allows them to stay abreast of regulatory changes. Article 19 systematically reanalyzes the legal environment of its host countries every few years and relies on its country experts to understand how changes in the practical operating environment might influence its ability to continue to engage in advocacy.[^51] 

A final source of Article 19's programmatic flexibility is its close collaborative relationships with more than 90 different governments, IGOs, and INGOs.[^52] In addition to working closely with the British, Norwegian, and Swedish governments (who are its largest governmental funders), Article 19 was a founding member of the International Freedom of Expression Exchange (IFEX), a global network of advocacy NGOs created in 1992 [@Sharpe:2000, 46]. Today, IFEX boasts more than 100 organizational members, including prominent human rights organizations like the Electronic Frontier Foundation, Human Rights Watch, Reporters without Borders, and PEN International.[^53] Participation in issue networks like IFEX boosts Article 19's lobbying and litigation capacity and grants it access to countries and resources that are closed off due to gatekeeping regulations.

## Maintaining access to restrictive countries

Restrictions on individual freedom of expression have increased in concert with restrictions in civic space and associational life—authoritarian states are increasingly cracking down on both speech and civil society. While Article 19 is primarily concerned with maintaining freedom of expression, it must also confront the more restrictive legal operating environments in the countries it works in. The organization recognizes this, noting that "civic space isn't closing—it's closed."[^54] In the past few years, Article 19 has become more conscious about maintaining access to repressive target countries. Its 2014 annual report, entitled "Protecting Civic Space," not only outlined the organization's legislative and advocacy accomplishments from the previous year, but explained how more restrictive anti-NGO legislation had made it more difficult to engage in their work. Paddy Coulter, chairman of the organization, observed that "2014 was a year of growth for us: growth in the threats to information and media freedoms around the world but also in our capacity to respond" [@a19:2014, 3]. This willingness and "capacity to respond"—or what I term instrumental flexibility—has allowed Article 19 to creatively adapt to increasingly burdensome gatekeeping regulations over the past decade. In particular, the organization has made specific strategic shifts to allow it to cope with restrictions targeting both entry and its programs.

### Responses to entry restrictions

On its face, moving strategic planning and implementation away from the organization's central offices in London was designed to enhance the organization's access to remote partners, allowing it to "respond more swiftly to opportunities or crises, … be closer to [its] partners, work more closely with them, and thus be more capable to respond to their demands and strengthen interactions and capacities" [@a19:2008, 38]. Beyond enhancing the organization's programmatic efficiency by moving its experts to the field, decentralization also provided legal and regulatory benefits and allowed Article 19's central offices to better handle the complexities of each country's gatekeeping and registration regulations. These offices were formally registered according to each country's foreign NGO regulations, and to smooth the registration process, each office was established as part of projects funded by large donors. Article 19 Mexico, for example, was created in 2008 as part of a Right to Information (RTI) advocacy campaign funded by the Hewlett Foundation—its local registration was incidental to the overall program. The other regional offices followed a similar pattern: Article 19 Brazil and Article 19 Bangladesh were both incorporated in 2008 while implementing RTI programs funded by DFID, while Article 19 Kenya was registered in 2007 to undertake a project in Sudan funded by the European Commission and the Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs [@a19:2008, 38]. Article 19 collaborated with its funders to overcome and avoid registration hurdles. Not only did bundling the registration of its regional offices with larger grants sponsored by governmental aid agencies like DFID and the European Commission expedite the registration process in each country, linking registration to grant fulfillment imbued Article 19's regional offices and programs with international backing and legitimacy.

Article 19 further ensured the success of their remote registration status by strategically selecting countries with the most amenable and navigable civil society regulatory environments, essentially choosing the "best house in a bad neighborhood" [@BarryBellClay:2015]. As mentioned previously, Article 19 reanalyzes legal trends in its various host countries to ensure that its mission aligns with the regulatory environments of its various target countries. Gatekeeping regulations factor into their decisions to expand to other countries. In the past decade, the organization has considered establishing a more formal presence in countries like Egypt and China, but concluded that the regulatory environments for INGOs in these countries would require too much effort and too many legal resources to keep any offices open.[^55]

When deciding where to expand its regional offices, Article 19 selects countries where it can have the most impact—both in-country and throughout the region—with the least amount of government interference. Brazil, Bangladesh, Mexico, Kenya, Senegal, and Tunisia each have more relaxed and friendlier laws than their regional neighbors. Registering as an international NGO in India, Ethiopia, Sudan, or Egypt, for instance, is more expensive, complicated, and risky than working from Bangladesh, Kenya, or Tunisia. The organization formally registered its office in Tunisia in 2011 precisely because it was the "safe option."[^56] Because post-revolutionary laws regarding NGO registration were more open than any other country in the region, Tunis became a safe central home base for Article 19's Middle Eastern work. 

Article 19 can afford to be selective in where it places its regional offices because of its large budget and international flexibility. Since it already has an established headquarters in London, it can take time to deliberate and debate possible regional offices. With consistent revenue, it can take more risks as it expands its programs. The Tunis office was formally incorporated in 2011, but as explained below, Article 19 has been active in Tunisia since at least 2004. Rather than establish regional offices from scratch, the organization builds on existing work and connections. Additionally, because it has multiple programs spread across the world, the organization can close and relocate its offices more easily. In the 1990s, prior to the organization's official policy of decentralization, it incorporated Article 19 South Africa as a regional subsidiary organization. Rising operational costs and increasing difficulties with coordination led to the office's closure in 2004 [@Stroup:2012, 180; @a19-fin:2004], but leaving the country did not have an overly negative effect on Article 19's programs in the region. From its base in London, the organization continued to hold workshops, lobby politicians, consult bureaucrats, and litigate against censorship throughout the region in 2004 [@a19:2004; @a19:2005]. While it has not yet been forced out of any of its current regional offices because of gatekeeping regulations, past experience shows that Article 19 would likely be able to absorb and adapt to such a change because of its flexibility, shifting resources and staff around to different regional or home offices.

### Responses to programmatic restrictions

Gatekeeping laws exist not only to filter out organizations that can cause potential political risks—governments can enact legislation or arbitrarily implement existing regulations to make life difficult for organizations already in their countries. While registration laws predominantly affect Article 19's regional offices, the organization must contend with regulations that target and restrict the organization's programming in all countries where it engages in advocacy, including countries where it does not have a permanent formal presence. In its 2014 annual report, dedicated to closing civic space, Article 19 noted that programming restrictions—particularly legal and security threats against in-country staff—were one of the most urgent challenges to undertaking its mission. Executive director Thomas Hughes observed, "Unfortunately, 2014 was marked by a deteriorating security environment for us and our partners. Threats against staff increased, mirroring the global trend of greater suppression and restriction of individuals and institutions defending human rights" [@a19:2014, 4]. 

Article 19 has responded to rising security threats by increasing its spending on security services, hiring and contracting additional guards, translators, fixers, and support staff. This additional security support has allowed the organization to continue its work in its various target countries, but it has imposed significant costs and increased expenditures by roughly 10%.[^57] For instance, in 2014 one staff member was detained in Ethiopia on his way to conduct a safety training workshop. Immigration officials confiscated his passport and phone and denied him access to legal advice [@a19:2014, 15]. In response, Article 19 had to unexpectedly increase its Ethiopian advocacy, lobbying against the government both for imprisoned journalists and bloggers and for the safety and continued access of program staff in the country. Similarly, following the passage of a new anti-terrorism and national security law in Kenya that granted the government the ability to arbitrarily reexamine or cancel the registrations of civil society organizations,[^58] Article 19 increased both its security spending and its litigation against the regime, responses made possible by the organization's reliable access to revenue and its professional legal staff. 

In many of its target countries, laws and regulations prohibit Article 19 from engaging in different forms of advocacy. The organization has a diverse menu of possible advocacy activities, and it selects which programs to offer based on both the needs and the practical operating environment of the target country. Because Article 19 works in dozens of different countries and engages in a wide variety of forms of advocacy, it can match its programming to its host legal environment, continue its mission, and maintain some access to the country without fundamentally changing its vision.

For instance, Article 19 faces intense opposition to its pro-speech litigation in countries with strict blasphemy laws. In Sudan in 2008, the organization created the Khartoum Advocacy Centre Blog and worked with local lawyers to advocate on behalf of a journalist imprisoned on charges of blasphemy. However, in 2009, following government hostility and threats, Article 19 closed down the blog and helped its local partners leave the country [@a19:2009, 7]. The organization adopted a "new strategy of interventions" targeted at Sudan and has continued its advocacy efforts from exile, criticizing the country for censorship and speech-based discrimination through regular reports and through presentations before the African Commission on Human and Peoples' Rights [@a19:2009; @a19:2011]. In the case of Iran, which prohibits all speech that promotes homosexuality, all of Article 19's LGBT-focused advocacy occurs online only, and the organization makes no attempt to have a physical presence in the country.[^59] Gatekeeping laws focused on INGO programs keep Article 19 out of the country, but through regular contact with exiled activists and their prolific use of internet publishing (as seen in @fig:a19-me-reports, Iran receives the most published attention in the Middle East), the organization continues to engage in its mission of promoting freedom of expression. Article 19's diverse menu of programming enables it to creatively respond and adapt to regulations that restrict its in-country activities.

As Article 19 regularly notes, the rights of expression and assembly are deeply linked: "the defence of freedom of expression and access to information is essentially the defence of civic space" [@a19:2014, 8]. Because improvements to expression rights lead to improvements in assembly rights, one of Article 19's more unique responses to legal restrictions on civil society is to lobby the government for regulatory and statutory reforms in both expression and assembly, advancing "progressive interpretations of human rights laws that allow people to gather, speak, and seek information" [@a19:2014, 8] and "embed[ding] freedom of expression in the infrastructure of government" [@a19:2015, 31]. Article 19's litigation and consultation on issues of freedom of expression allow the organization to shape the legal environments of its target countries. This, in turn, has powerful knock-on effects: improving the legal environment in one country allows the organization to maintain its access throughout the region. 

Tunisia provides a prime example of this phenomenon. Article 19 began working in the country in 2005 as part of the Tunisia Monitoring Group (IFEX-TMG), a special eight-year endeavor organized by IFEX. Working with regional and international partners such as the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information, Index on Censorship, Freedom House, and the Egyptian Organization for Human Rights, IFEX-TMG sent regular fact-finding and consulting missions to Tunisia, culminating in multiple reports outlining legislative recommendations to enhance media freedom, end censorship, and improve the rights of association, assembly, and movement [@ifex-tmg:2005; @ifex-tmg:2010]. Under President Zine El Abidine Ben ʿAli, few of the recommendations had a change of being implemented. However, following the president's overthrow during the 2011 Arab Spring uprising, Article 19 was ideally positioned to influence human rights policy in the country, and it opened a formal regional office in Tunis. Building on relationships established during IFEX-TMG missions, newly-elected Tunisian politicians solicited technical advice from Article 19 on issues related to freedom of expression and human rights more generally. The organization held workshops for legislators, offered regular comments on the nascent constitution, and worked with the president and party chairs to ensure that the legal environment for speech and assembly in the newly democratizing country would be safe and inviting [@a19:2012]. In January 2014, the country's National Constituent Assembly (NCA) adopted a new constitution that generally accorded with international human rights standards. Prominent politicians cited Article 19's assistance throughout the drafting process, including interim president Moncef Marzouki and NCA president Mustapha Ben Jafar [@a19:2014, 16].

The final post-revolutionary constitution was not perfect, and subsequent governments have continued to infringe on expression rights. However, secure in its legal status, Article 19 has been able to maintain the contentiousness of its work in Tunisia, issuing 87 advocacy letters and statements since the fall of Ben ʿAli in 2011 (see @fig:a19-me-reports), condemning government abuses, censorship, and arrests of journalists and activists. The organization's close connections with local politicians—as well as the more permissive legal environment for advocacy in general—allow Article 19 to continue its mission and litigate against the government.

![Advocacy letters, reports, legal analyses, policy briefs, press releases, statements, and updates published by Article 19 in the Middle East, 2011–2017](../../Output/figures/4-a19-me-reports){#fig:a19-me-reports}

Additionally, Article 19 has been able to use Tunisia as a regional home base. Egypt, Syria, Bahrain, and other Middle Eastern countries have all imposed strict gatekeeping regulations, either by preventing registration or by imposing rules that make human rights advocacy illegal. To get around these restrictions, Article 19 brings regional activists to its Tunisia office for training and research, rather than sending staff to those more restrictive countries.[^60] As a result, despite closed and dangerous civic space, Article 19 has been able to maintain the contentiousness of its post-Arab Spring advocacy, issuing reports and policy briefs to countries throughout the region (see @fig:a19-me-reports). Using its Tunisian office as a regional hub and tool for circumventing gatekeeping laws, however, is only possible because of the organization's programmatic flexibility. Collaboration with IFEX-TMG, politicians, and local NGOs in the years prior to the revolution, consistent government- and foundation-based funding, and highly trained staff allowed Article 19 to rapidly establish an office in 2011 and have positioned the organization to remain active in the region.

The laws impeding Article 19's work are not generally designed to take control over its mission—rather, these regulations are designed to make operating an INGO abroad more difficult and costly. Article 19 has been able to adapt to these increasingly onerous gatekeeping regulations by relying on its large budget, its large menu of possible programs, its longstanding host government partnerships, and its network of regional offices. By drawing on these resources, the organization has been able to maintain alignment with regime preferences and remain active in dozens of countries *without* fundamentally changing its core mission or values.


# AMERA UK / Egypt / International

Article 19's reserves of programmatic flexibility allowed it circumvent gatekeeping regulations and maintain its antagonistic relationship with its target countries. Following the theoretical argument, INGOs that are more cooperative and undertake programs that are more aligned with regime preferences will face less regulatory pressure, and subsequently require less flexibility to stay active in their target countries. However, maintaining a small, low-budget INGO carries risks, even if the organization engages in regime-aligned programs. The case of  AMERA International demonstrates how changes in a country's civil society regulatory environment can shrink the practical operating environment so much that naturally cooperative INGOs find themselves at risk of expulsion.

## Mission and strategy

In the wake of mass displacements of people in India and Pakistan in 1947 and Korea in 1950, the United Nations held a Conference of Plenipotentiaries on the Status of Refugees and Stateless Persons in 1951. This conference issued the 1951 Refugee Convention (later expanded with a 1967 protocol), which established the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), created legal standards for designating displaced people as refugees, and laid out the responsibilities of signatory states in protecting refugee rights. Specifically, the Convention and subsequent Protocol define a refugee as someone who is out of their country of nationality, has a well-founded fear of persecution because of race, religion, nationality, social group, or political opinion, and is unable to return to their home country for fear of persecution [@unhcr-protocol]. Recipient countries have a responsibility to provide a standard of care for refugees, but legal refugee status is not automatic—recipient countries must determine the cause and extent of the fear of persecution and the reason behind that persecution. 

As a result of this ambiguity, the contemporary legal landscape for refugees is fraught with complications. Determination of asylum status is expensive, time consuming, and fraught with risk, as recipient countries are often unwilling to accept refugees. Refugees are also particularly vulnerable to sex and labor trafficking, especially since many are dependent on smugglers to leave their home countries [@Gallagher:2002]. Obtaining legal services is cost prohibitive and asylum seekers are often unable to access their rights as refugees. 

After 15 years of fieldwork among refugees in West Africa, British anthropologist Dr. Barbara Harrell-Bond founded the Refugee Studies Centre at Oxford, one of the first academic research centers focused on the modern complexities of refugee law. Following her retirement, she moved between Kenya, Uganda, and Egypt, establishing legal assistance programs for refugees in those countries. Building on her years of expertise in studying and working with refugees, in 2003, Dr. Harrell-Bond and a board of trustees founded Africa and Middle East Refugee Assistance UK (AMERA UK), driven by the belief that "legal aid … is the right of all refugees."[^61] AMERA's mission is to "provide pro bono legal aid for refugees in countries where such services are non-existent or limited and where legal representation might assist them in actualizing their rights."[^62] Since its incorporation in 2003, AMERA UK (now AMERA International)[^63] has provided a variety of programs designed to assist refugees, including pro bono litigation and advocacy, refugee status determination, social support for survivors of human trafficking and sex- and gender-based violence, resettlement assistance, and assistance for unaccompanied minors. True to its name, AMERA has worked exclusively in the Middle East and North Africa, operating primarily in Egypt and Uganda, with new partnerships in Cameroon and Morocco beginning in 2012 (see @fig:amera-partners).

## Sources of flexibility (and inflexibility)

When compared with Article 19, AMERA has had a far more tumultuous experience with anti-INGO laws, despite its less contentious mission. The fall of former Egyptian president Ḥosni Mubarak during the 2011 Arab Spring uprising marked a crisis for the organization and eventually led to its exit from the country. AMERA's lower levels of instrumental resources meant that as the civil society regulatory environment in post-revolutionary Egypt shrank, the practical operating environment—or the overlap between AMERA's flexibility and the Egyptian regime's tolerance for INGO services—constricted accordingly. AMERA had multiple sources of flexibility while working in Egypt, including well-trained staff and close collaborative relationships with similar refugee rights organizations, but because of irregular and uncertain revenue, it was unable to continue operating in the new legal environment. Between 2013–14, AMERA UK closed down its AMERA Egypt office, transferred its operations to the Egyptian Foundation for Refugee rights, a local Egyptian-run NGO, and rebranded itself as AMERA International.

AMERA enjoyed multiple sources of flexibility that were valuable in maintaining its access to Egypt for so long. First, the organization had a small staff, ranging from 20–30 full time employees between 2004 and 2013, split between AMERA UK and AMERA Egypt (see bottom panel of @fig:amera-budget-staff).[^64] The organization also relied on volunteer interns to help with paralegal, administrative, and translation work. Staff and volunteers were diverse, well-trained, and fit the needs of the organization's constituents. For instance, in 2010, the ten staff and volunteer members of AMERA's refugee status determination legal team consisted of five Americans, and one each from Rwanda, France, Ireland, Palestine, and Egypt. The team's language skills and legal expertise helped it provide legal aid and representation to nearly 1,400 clients [@amera:2010, 3]. All other departments saw similar diversity in the nationality of their staff—again in 2010, the psychosocial counseling department was led by British, Somali, Italian, and Egyptian psychologists, while the community outreach department was headed by an Egyptian assisted by staff from Sudan, Somalia, Ethiopia, and Eritrea, each of whom were able to maintain close contacts with refugees from their respective countries [@amera:2010]. Egyptians on staff gave AMERA resources to confront the changing legal environment, while staff and volunteers from East Africa allowed the organization to maximize its impact in the refugee community in Cairo.

AMERA also cultivated many partnerships with various refugee and human rights organizations in Egypt, including the Egyptian Foundation for Refugee Rights, Refuge Egypt, Caritas, the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), St. Andrews Refugee Services, Catholic Relief Services, and the El Nadeem Center for Psychological Rehabilitation of Victims of Violence and Torture. In partnering with these organizations, AMERA Egypt was able to connect refugees with additional psychological, financial, and legal support, as well as shelter, food, family reunion services, education, and medical care. More importantly, this collaboration put AMERA at the center of a growing network of refugee-related NGOs in Cairo [@amera:2013, 2], a position that later proved instrumental for continued service provision after the organization left the country.

Unlike Article 19, which operates in dozens of different countries from its home and regional offices, AMERA did not enjoy geographic flexibility, primarily because the type of programming the two organizations offer is fundamentally different. While Article 19 can send activists and researchers into countries to gather information and data, AMERA's refugee assistance requires direct one-on-one legal advocacy on the ground. As such, the organization was naturally more limited in the geographic scope of their work. AMERA UK was created to be an overarching international umbrella organization for assisting with refugee rights throughout the region, serving "as a model and catalyst for the development of new refugee legal aid programs throughout the global south" [@amera:2007, 3]. AMERA UK began its work in Uganda and Egypt, establishing the Refugee Law Project and AMERA Egypt respectively as the main organization's in-country headquarters. Due to their labor-intensive programs, running these offices required significant funding and time to build up connections to funders, partners, and refugees. AMERA's work in Uganda was an early success, and the Refugee Law Project was soon spun off into an independent NGO. AMERA UK stopped including updates about the Refugee Law Project in its 2010 trustees' report, and its fundraising commitments ended in 2013 [@amera:2010, 3; @amera:2013]. In 2012, AMERA UK identified and began working with new partners in Morocco (Droit et Justice) and Cameroon (Refugee Welfare Association Cameroon, or REWAC) [@amera:2012], but due to budget crises and legal challenges in Egypt, the expansion has been slow. Moving its programs between countries that impose legal restrictions, therefore, is a cumbersome and long process and has not proven to be an effective response to legal crackdowns.

![AMERA's income, expenditures, and full time staff, 2004–15](../../Output/figures/4-amera-budget-staff){#fig:amera-budget-staff}

AMERA's most significant obstacle to maintaining its programmatic flexibility in the face of repressive regulations, however, was its inconsistent and unpredictable revenue (see @fig:amera-budget-staff). Since its inception, the organization has received the majority of its funding from donations from Comic Relief, a UK-based nonprofit that raises millions pounds during its annual Red Nose Day celebrity-heavy comedy specials broadcast on the BBC. As seen in the middle panel of @fig:amera-budget-staff, grants from Comic Relief accounted for roughly 85% of AMERA's income in 2004, and has constituted between 50–90% of the organization's revenue since then. Comic Relief funding sharply decreased in 2013, just as AMERA Egypt faced the most pressure and scrutiny, and by 2015 the two organizations' partnership appears to have ended. Recognizing the lack of diversification in its income, AMERA sought out other sources of revenue and between 2005–07, it received grants from the Sigrid Rausing Trust, the Amberstone Trust, and the Ford Foundation. In 2007–08, AMERA UK hired its first executive director with the intention of stabilizing the organization's revenue [@amera:2008, 2]. AMERA received grants from many other family foundations and NGOs like the ICRC, and sought out grants from foreign governments, ultimately receiving money from the Swiss and US embassies in Cairo and the US State Department's Bureau of Population, Refugees, and Migration (PRM). In 2008, AMERA's income peaked at more than £600,000, but in following years, the organization slowly lost foundation and government funding, and by 2015, it was funded exclusively by a grant from PRM and £5,000 in private donations. Losing its funding from Comic Relief and struggling to maintain regular foundation and government funding put AMERA in a precarious situation as it confronted legal and safety challenges in Egypt, and the organization's lack of flexibility in revenue was a key factor in leaving the country.

## Reactions to registration restrictions and losing access to Egypt

AMERA faced few programmatic restrictions while working in Egypt—laws regulating speech, assembly, and advocacy were rarely an issue for the organization, as it dealt primarily with individual refugees confronting the international and Egyptian legal systems. Its most challenging legal obstacle, and the issue that led to its withdrawal from the country, was its inability to formally register as a civil society organization, which in turn posed a threat to its safety and continued operations in Egypt. Unlike AMERA's Refugee Law Project in Uganda, AMERA Egypt was never able to become fully independent because of unclear and uncertain gatekeeping laws.

Prior to the bevy of draft legislation in the wake of the 2011 uprising, civil society organizations in Egypt were governed solely by Law 84 of 2002. Law 84 ostensibly required that all civil society organizations—both domestic and foreign—be registered with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and prohibited informal or unregistered associations. In practice, however, Egyptian officials enforced this law with great discretion, and many NGOs did not register. AMERA UK began the process of registering AMERA Egypt as its official branch in Cairo in 2010, having already worked in the country for several years [@amera:2010, 3]. The organization did not feel overly rushed to complete the process, and it received little pressure from the government. One AMERA director noted that "[b]ecause we were doing what the government was happy to have done, the government tolerated us,"[^65] despite the lack of official registration. AMERA Egypt partnered with a local law firm that provided pro bono legal support for the registration process [@amera:2011, 7], and it waited for its application to work through the slow Egyptian bureaucracy. 

In January 2011, however, the practical operating environment for AMERA and all international NGOs working in Egypt changed dramatically. AMERA Egypt periodically shut down its main offices during the worst political unrest, and staff met with clients offsite to continue the organization's work with as few interruptions as possible [@amera:2011, 2]. Despite the unrest, AMERA continued to assist with asylum applications, legal consulting, and victim counseling, but at the same time, the trustees began to set aside reserves to ensure that the organization could "meet the costs of closure or wind-down" if circumstances warranted it [@amera:2011, 5]. The registration application with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs stalled amidst the political upheaval and the organization continued to wait.

AMERA continued its work through 2012 and 2013, but a large influx of refugees from Syria, an increasingly restricted and dangerous practical operating environment, and a dramatic drop in funds put incredible pressure on the organization. To cope with these challenges, AMERA Egypt increasingly relied on assistance from its partners, working with ten different NGOs to supplement their services. The organization's registration application remained in flux, and President Morsi's draft legislation targeting foreign funding raised the specter of uncertainty. Without formal registration as a civil society organization, AMERA Egypt would not be able to obtain permission to receive funding from AMERA UK, and the organization would need to close. 

The relationship between AMERA Egypt and the Egyptian government had been amicable—police never raided their offices, detained staff, or confiscated resources. Every time the organization communicated with its contacts at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, they were told that the application was in order, but final approval from the Ministry never arrived and their registration status was perpetually pending. However, beginning in 2013, AMERA UK worried that the détente would soon come to an end. The Ministry had upped its pressure on other international humanitarian organizations like Oxfam, and state security forces regularly raided local NGOs receiving foreign funding.[^66] By the end of 2013, AMERA UK "saw the handwriting on the wall," assumed that its legal status would never be secured, and began the process of transferring the operations of AMERA Egypt to the Egyptian Foundation for Refugee Rights (EFRR).[^67]

As AMERA's practical operating environment in Egypt worsened, the organization lacked sufficient resources to maintain its access to the country—in particular because of its irregular and uncertain income. In 2014, AMERA UK closed AMERA Egypt, temporarily reincorporated as the International Refugee Rights Initiative (IRRI) in the UK [@amera:2014], and continued to send grants to EFRR, though with little input into the management of its programs. In October 2014, EFRR took full control over all programs, and in 2015, IRRI completed its drawdown from Egypt, changed its name to AMERA International, and slowly began to expand its fundraising and training activities in Morocco and Cameroon [@amera:2015].

# Conclusion

Autocratic governments rely on gatekeeping regulations to limit the potential destabilizing influence of international NGOs working in their countries. Laws regarding registration, assembly, speech, and general INGO programming allow governments to filter out unwanted organizations, either by gumming up INGO operations and making life more difficult and costly, or by preventing INGOs from entering their countries in the first place. 

Findings from the survey show that INGOs confronting gatekeeping regulations are most concerned with entering or remaining in the target country. Organizations that undertake issues that are aligned with regime preferences willingly register, engage in self-censorship, and publicly demonstrating their political neutrality to demonstrate their compliance. As the relationship between INGOs and governments becomes more antagonistic, compliance becomes more difficult. Under these circumstances, INGOs draw on their range of programmatic flexibility to either creatively adapt to the regulations or avoid the government entirely.

Importantly, in the case of both Article 19 and AMERA, the governments imposing gatekeeping laws do not attempt to assert control over or induce changes to their programs. Rather, these laws are designed to make it more costly to operate in the organizations' target countries. INGOs that can afford to spend additional resources to maintain access do so. Article 19 was successful in proactively reshaping the associational and speech laws in Tunisia because of its longstanding relationships with key government officials and its deep connections with local partners and larger networks of similar INGOs. As a result of the more open legal environment in Tunisia, the organization has been able to maintain the contentiousness of its work there and throughout the region.

Smaller and less contentious organizations do not typically face additional gatekeeping burdens because of their alignment with regime preferences—their relationship with their host regimes is naturally more cooperative. When political contexts change and regulations become better enforced, small INGOs cannot adapt effectively. AMERA's departure from Egypt occurred because of a worsening civil society regulatory environment. Facing the threat of political instability in the wake of the Arab Spring uprising, Presidents Morsi and Sisi constrained the allowable space for civil society advocacy by threatening to pass (and later, actually passing) additional gatekeeping laws to keep foreign NGOs out of the country. Even though AMERA's refugee assistance activities were closely aligned with regime preferences, in the face of low flexibility and high regulatory uncertainty, it transferred its key programs to other organizations and left the country.
